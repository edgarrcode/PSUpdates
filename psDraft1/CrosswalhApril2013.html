<h2 id="PeopleSoft">PeopleSoft Info Fair Provided A Glimpse Of The Future</h2>

<p>To give BIS and HRMS users a glimpse of the future, the PeopleSoft Team held an Info Fair on March 7. Over 300 employees attended the event. Several PeopleSoft team members gave demonstrations on various HR and Finance modules that will be deployed on September 1, 2013. Team members were also on hand throughout the four-hour event to talk with attendees, show them different PeopleSoft screens on their computers, discuss upcoming training opportunities, and answer questions.</p>

<p>Most users of BIS and HRMS know that PeopleSoft will be replacing the legacy DEFINE system on September 1. But they hadn’t seen much of what PeopleSoft looks like until now. While there is still some anxiety about converting to a new system for Finance and HR processing, most attendees were enthusiastic about the pending conversion.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Fierro, business center specialist for the College of Engineering, said she is excited about the Web-based user interface. “The drop down menus and easy-to-use search features of PeopleSoft make it much more user friendly. It will be a positive change for the University,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="ReportsTo">Who Do You “Reports To”?</h2>
<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/manager-self-service.png" alt="manager with three reports-to people" Title="manager with three reports-to people">

<p>You may have heard the term “reports to” over the past month or so in conjunction with PeopleSoft. Every department has a “reports to” structure, although this relationship may be more clearly defined in some departments than in others. The reports-to structure governs the approval process for many HR documents and other activities requiring approval such as recruitment, changes to positions, and supplements of additional pay, travel and expense reimbursements, leave requests, sick time reporting, and time keeping.</p>

<p>While this information is currently entered in DEFINE, it must be reviewed carefully and updated before the conversion to PeopleSoft to ensure that the correct approval structures are implemented for each department. Note that the reports-to assignments are tied to positions, not employees, which will help to facilitate easy updating when necessary (for example, when an employee takes another position at UTEP). </p>

<p>In May, members of the PeopleSoft project team will begin meeting with college and division leadership to review the current DEFINE reports to structure for each department. This information will be updated in DEFINE, then converted to PeopleSoft so that it is correct in the system for go-live on September. To ensure that the reports-to data is accurate at go-live, departments should continue to update the data as needed between May and August.</p>

<h2 id="AccessRoles">Access Roles And Security In PeopleSoft</h2>
<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/LoginImage.jpg" alt="Password Fields" Title="Password Fields">

<p>One of the benefits of the PeopleSoft implementation will be heightened security regarding access to University data. Unlike with the current DEFINE system, where access is granted by desk, access to the different modules in PeopleSoft will be defined by roles. While all employees will have access to perform basic tasks (such as requesting vacation, reporting sick time, and viewing their personal information) via the Employee Self Service module (which replaces UT Direct functions), others will be granted access to different modules in the system based on their job duties. </p>

<p>Your job duties will define the roles you are assigned in PeopleSoft, and thus what data and tasks you are able to access. Unlike with DEFINE where employees often have to log in to multiple desks to complete tasks, you will need to log in to PeopleSoft only once.</p>

<p>The PeopleSoft project team will be working closely with college and division leadership to review and assign proper access roles to employees in each department. Those employees who use the current DEFINE system to do their jobs or support their departments will be assigned access roles to allow them to continue performing those job duties in PeopleSoft. </p>

<p>Prior to go-live, some users will be contacted to test their access roles. Adjustments will be made as necessary. </p>

<p>After go-live, the process for assigning access roles will be managed by a security access administrator in the IT department. Departments will need to make a request for access roles for their employees, as access will not be granted automatically. Additionally, some roles will require user training before they can be assigned. When employees accept another position on campus, their access role(s) will be terminated and their new department will need to request a new access role based on the duties of the new position. In other words, your access roles will not follow you from position to position. </p>

<p>Since we know that access and security will be big issues for our campus users, the PeopleSoft team will be providing more information as we move closer to go-live.</p>

<h2 id="SME">SME Spotlight: Laura Gutierrez</h2>

Laura Gutierrez is the subject matter expert (SME) for the PeopleSoft project overseeing the General Ledger module and is the Financial Management System (FMS) suite lead at UTEP. She has a bachelor of business administration (accountancy) from UTEP, and accounting experience in both the private and public sector. Learn more about Laura and her role in the project.
 
<h3>Prior To Your Assignment To PeopleSoft, What Was Your Job At UTEP?</h3>

I am an assistant director in Accounting and Business Services, and work primarily with Financial Reporting; I’ve been with the department since 2000. Financial Reporting oversees all external and internal reports, prepares the annual financial report, and monitors all financial activities of the university.

<h3>What Is Your Involvement Within The PeopleSoft Project?</h3>

I’ve been on the project since its inception in early 2011, when UT Dallas first converted to PeopleSoft. Before that, I was involved in the fit/gap analysis that took place back in 2009 when the UT System first began evaluating products to replace DEFINE.
 
<h3>What Advice Do You Have For People To Help Them Through The PeopleSoft Conversion?</h3>

Be patient, and ask questions! People will find that some aspects of PeopleSoft will be very similar to what they’re used to now in BIS and HRMS, but there will definitely be some differences. As they go through training and begin to use the new system, people should not be afraid to ask questions. There will be many sources of help available to users.
 
<h3>When You Were Little, What Did You Want To Be When You Grew Up?</h3>

I wanted to be an elementary or middle school teacher, teaching math. I do deal with numbers, but I don’t have my summers off!

<p>The General Ledger (GL) module is the official record of financial transactions in PeopleSoft. As the foundation of the university’s financial system, GL provides the account structure and reporting structure that affects all other modules within PeopleSoft.</p>

<p>According to Laura Gutierrez, the PeopleSoft subject matter expert (SME) overseeing the General Ledger module, little will change for front-office users. “For the most part, the changes that come with PeopleSoft will occur at the back-office level,” Laura said. “Front-office users will see some changes in terminology, but they’ll be provided with crosswalks so that they can get comfortable with the new terms.”</p>

<p>According to Laura, not all terms in PeopleSoft are replacing terms we currently use. “Some terms we currently use will come to mean something different in PeopleSoft,” she said. The term “object code” as we know it now will be the “account” in PeopleSoft. “Account” as we know it now will be called the “cost center” in PeopleSoft.</p>

<p>Other than learning the new terminology, users will find that most of the principles of the account setup will remain the same. Staff will continue to be able to see how much money they have in an account and how the money that was disbursed was spent. If a department needs to request the setup of a new account number (which is called a “cost center” in PeopleSoft), the setup will continue to occur at the back office level.</p>

Want to learn more about PeopleSoft? Start with PeopleSoft terminology. We’ll define a few PeopleSoft terms in every newsletter. See more by viewing the <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/PeopleSoft%20Glossary_081512.pdf">UTEP Glossary of PeopleSoft Terms</a>.

<h3>Account</h3>

<p>The Account chartfield (Object Code in DEFINE) captures the nature of a financial transaction that is entered into the system. </p>

There are normally five account types:<br>
A = Asset<br>
L = Liability<br>
Q = Equity<br>
E = Expense<br>
R = Revenue<br>
<br>
The Account field is five characters. The first digit also reflects the type of account:<br>
1 = Assets<br>
2 = Liabilities<br>
3 = Fund Equity<br>
4 = Revenue<br>
5 = Salary & Wages Exp <br>
6 = Expense<br>
7 = Transfers and Adjustments<br>
8 = Capital Expense<br>
<br>
DEFINE equivalent: Object Code

<h3>Cost Center</h3>

A Cost Center in PeopleSoft is the equivalent of an Account in DEFINE. 

<h3>Crosswalk</h3>

The translation of a DEFINE value to a PeopleSoft value. A crosswalk table will be developed to identify all the legacy chartfield values and their new PeopleSoft chartfields.

<h3>Role</h3>

Refers to PeopleSoft security. The role identifies the particular PeopleSoft functionality that an individual is able to access.
