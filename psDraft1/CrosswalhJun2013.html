<h2 id="PeopleSoft">PeopleSoft Go-Live Date Postponed</h2>

<p>A recent UT Share-level review of the PeopleSoft implementation project has determined that the go-live date for the conversion should be postponed. As you may know, the implementation of PeopleSoft is a UT Share initiative involving a collaborative effort between seven different UT institutions. The decision to postpone was made after an evaluation of the current status of the project.</p>

<p>According to a memo sent to project team members by Dr. Scott Kelley, the UT Share executive sponsor for the project, the UT Share team has been committed from the beginning to delivering a quality product. Although the participating institutions have worked tirelessly over the past two years to configure PeopleSoft for our needs, the complexity associated with an implementation of this scale mandates continued diligence in testing, training, and data conversion and validation. In short, more time is needed to ensure a smooth and successful transition.</p>

<p>“Here at UTEP, we will continue our commitment to delivering a quality product that we know our users will feel comfortable using,” said Cindy Villa, Vice President for Business Affairs and member of the UT Share executive committee.  “We would like to extend our appreciation to everyone on campus for their enthusiasm and support, as we continue to strive toward meeting our goals.” </p>

<p>Going forward, the PeopleSoft project management team will be regrouping and re-establishing meeting timelines and training schedules in alignment with the go-live date.  We will continue to keep you informed as more information becomes available.</p>

<h2 id="QAndA">Q & A With Anthony Turrietta</h2>

<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/Turrietta%20Anthony%201.jpg" alt="Anthony Turrietta" tilte="Anthony Turrietta">
Recently, Anthony Turrietta, Associate Vice President for Business Affairs sat down for a quick 
Q & A about PeopleSoft and what it means for staff members who use BIS/HRMS.

<h3>PeopleSoft Is A System That The Majority Of Our Staff Has Never Worked With Before. Should They Be Concerned About Learning How To Use PeopleSoft?</h3>

No, I don’t think they need to be overly concerned about this. What we want our employees to remember is that they’ve learned how to maneuver in HRMS and BIS—BIS is actually a very complicated system. PeopleSoft will be far more user-friendly than BIS ever was. If you learned how to use any of our other systems, you will be able to learn PeopleSoft. At the end of the day, PeopleSoft is just like any other automated human resource and financial management system. 

<h3>Will Employees See Major Changes In The Activities They Currently Perform?</h3>

Other than the system they are using, not much will change. Depending on what you do now, you’ll still do many of the same activities. Entering vouchers, requesting new positions, submitting travel authorizations—employees will still do those things—the change is that these activities will be done in PeopleSoft. 

<h3>So, PeopleSoft Will Not Be A Dramatic Change From What Most Staff Members Do Now?</h3>

We want people to understand that what is changing is manageable, and we want them to believe in their own capacity for that change. We have a broad spectrum of employees who continually demonstrate their expertise and capabilities in their areas. Using PeopleSoft will be just one component of the duties they perform as a part of their job. We view our employees as an invaluable part of how our university operates. That will not change once we convert to PeopleSoft.

<h3>Prior To Your Assignment To PeopleSoft, What Was Your Job At UTEP?</h3>

I was a special projects accounting manager at Business Services, where I was responsible for overseeing the compliance review for the university.

<h3>What Is Your Involvement Within The PeopleSoft Project?</h3>

I am a part of the project management team for the PeopleSoft project at UTEP. In that capacity I am the training lead, project manager for the Miner Mall integration with PeopleSoft, and I serve as support for our PeopleSoft campus project manager, Iris Niestas. As the training lead I am creating a structured training plan for campus, which includes developing training classes and working with our subject matter experts to develop training materials. As the project manager for the integration of Miner Mall and PeopleSoft, I am overseeing the development of an interface that will allow our campus users to continue using Miner Mall as their procurement system.

<h3>During Your Time On The Project, What Has Surprised You Most?</h3>

I’ve been surprised by the cohesiveness of our project team. This team has worked closely together now for going on two years, and they’ve developed bonds that will continue far into the future. 

<h3>What Advice Do You Have For People To Help Them Through The PeopleSoft Conversion?</h3>

I suggest that people be open-minded about PeopleSoft, but also understand that much of their work will remain the same. They will be performing the same tasks; it’s just that PeopleSoft will look differently. There will be a learning curve, but it should be easily overcome once users go through the system a few times.

<h3>When You Were Little, What Did You Want To Be When You Grew Up?</h3>

I wanted to be a baseball player for the Cubs, but before that I wanted to play basketball for the Miners! I’ve always had an interest in sports, and that continues through my support of our UTEP teams.

<h2 id="Auditing">Auditing And Consulting Services Partners With The PeopleSoft Team</h2>

<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/auditingthumb2.jpg" alt="Flowchart" tilte="Flowchart">

<p>As a future user of the PeopleSoft system, you may be wondering:  "How will things work in the new system?” </p>

<p>In an effort to help answer this question, the Office of Auditing and Consulting Services (OACS) is working with the PeopleSoft project team to map how eight key business processes will occur once we move to a PeopleSoft environment. The processes include travel reimbursements, payroll exceptions, expense management, employee on-boarding, Family and Medical Leave Act request process, employee off-boarding, recruitment, and position modification.</p>

<p>OACS met with the project team members representing areas such as Payroll, Accounts Payable, Human Resource Services and Contracts and Grants to draw a visual representation of how the processes will work in PeopleSoft. The objective of the meetings was <strong>not</strong> to recreate DEFINE business processes in PeopleSoft, but rather to determine how things will work in the new system. </p>

<p>During the meeting, participants were asked to consider the following questions about each of the processes: “what is?”, “what can be?”, and “what should be?” Team members were encouraged to be flexible and innovative, and were asked to identify opportunities to make improvements to how processes would work in the future.</p>

<p>The meetings will yield business process flowcharts and notes that the project team can use as training tools. Whit Madere, Assistant Director of the Office of Auditing and Consulting Services, notes: “We know that our processes will continue to evolve, and PeopleSoft will continue to be updated and improved after the implementation date.  As a result of our partnership with the PeopleSoft project team, at least for these eight processes we will have a common understanding of how they flow and impact people across campus.”</p>

<h3>Modules</h3>

Groupings of software programs that collectively support a specific business function. The UT Share PeopleSoft project will eventually deploy several  modules that support the HR and Finance functions for participating institutions. 

These are the modules that support our HR business functions and are part of the Human Capital Management (HCM) suite:

<h3>Human Resources (Position Management)</h3>

The Human Resources (HR) module maintains position and employee data. Data that is stored and updated in this module relates to employee, job, position, compensation, and benefit information.

<h3>Recruiting Solutions</h3>

This module is used to facilitate recruiting and hiring and is comprised of Talent Acquisition Manager (TAM) and Candidate Gateway (CG).

<h3>Benefits</h3>

This module manages multiple benefits programs, including plans for leave, health and life insurance, savings, and dependent care reimbursement.

<h3>Payroll/Time And Labor (Time Keeping)</h3>

Payroll and Time and Labor are two modules in PeopleSoft that work together to accurately calculate employees’ time and manage employees’ pay. Time and Labor serves as the time reporting system, which is fully integrated with Payroll.

<h3>Absence Management</h3>

This module tracks and processes paid and unpaid leave of absences, and the accrual of leave time based on an employee’s years of service. Absence Management is fully integrated with the Payroll and Time Keeping modules. 

<h3>Commitment Accounting (Budget)</h3>

This is the budgeting module for HR, which enables users to allocate salary costs to different funding sources.
