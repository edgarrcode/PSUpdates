<h2 id="FinalLaunch">Final Launch Date For PeopleSoft</h2>

<p>The launch date for the conversion to PeopleSoft has been announced as September 1, 2013. If you’ve attended any of our recent information sessions, you know that the PeopleSoft implementation is a shared project across eight participating UT System institutions—known collectively as UT Share. An enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, PeopleSoft is scheduled to replace our legacy DEFINE system for all finance (BIS) and Human Resources (HRMS) processes. For an overview of PeopleSoft, see the September Crosswalk newsletter.</p>

<h3>Why Does A Project Like This Take So Long?</h3>

<p>Unlike DEFINE, PeopleSoft is an “out-of-the-box” solution. This means that our project teams have had to work closely with each other and with our implementation partners to identify areas where the software must be configured to fulfill our processing needs. A large implementation such as this requires several phases, with each phase taking several months to complete. For the PeopleSoft implementation, the teams have completed the Plan & Discover Phase, the Analyze & Design Phase, and the Configure and Develop Phase. </p>

<p>At this point, the teams are now in the Testing Phase. The customized configurations that were identified and configured in the first three phases must be rigorously tested across the installed system and by members of all participating campuses to make sure they will work for all. Functional committee members from EACH campus must test each component of the system. </p>

<p>Within Testing, there are several stages that must be completed, one after another, to ensure that all components work separately and together.  “Our teams are in the system testing stage now and will be moving into the integration testing stage by early 2013,” says Iris Niestas, the PeopleSoft project manager. (For more information on different stages of Testing, see the October Crosswalk newsletter.)  She adds, “Testing is more complex than if we were simply testing a single installation at a single campus. Tracking and resolving all issues across eight different institutions takes time.” </p>

<p>By moving the launch date back to September 2013, we assure that the project teams have the time to properly address issues as they arise during testing—thus enhancing the quality of our implementation come September. Additionally, switching systems at the beginning of a fiscal year, while still very challenging, makes converting data a bit “cleaner.”  By converting at fiscal year-end, we will have a complete fiscal year’s data history in DEFINE, allowing us to more easily roll beginning balances to PeopleSoft. Finally, we will be able to build our year-end financial statements using data from one system, rather than having to gather and analyze data from two systems if we had launched PeopleSoft in mid-year. </p>

<h3>5/29/13 Update: The PeopleSoft Launch Date has been adjusted to March 1, 2014. </h3>

<h2 id="ModuleSpotlight">Module Spotlight: Absence Management</h2>
<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/absence_small.jpg" alt="Where are you?" Title="Where are you?">


<p>The Absence Management module tracks and processes paid and unpaid leave of absences, and the accrual of leave time based on an employee’s years of service. According to Sonya Villa-Saenz, the PeopleSoft team member overseeing Absence Management, the module has a direct impact on other modules within the PeopleSoft system. Leave taken will be tracked in your timesheet through the Time & Labor module. Your timesheet in turn is fully integrated with the Payroll module (see our September Crosswalk newsletter for more information on Payroll and Time & Labor).</p>

<p>One change that Absence Management will introduce when PeopleSoft goes live is that it does not allow an employee to go into negative leave balances. Leave time taken will be tied to an employee’s paycheck—if an employee has a negative leave balance, it will result in unpaid hours. However, an important feature was added to the Absence Management module in order to ensure that all options were exhausted before negative leave taken would result in an unpaid status. </p>

<p>“Cascading” is the automatic deduction of employee-submitted absence hours against a prioritized order for that employee’s accrued leave type balances. In other words, if an employee takes 20 hours of vacation leave, but only has 10 hours of vacation leave available, the system will pull the remaining 10 hours from another available leave type (e.g., compensatory time or overtime) before going into unpaid status for those hours taken. See the table below for the Cascading order for vacation and sick leave time. </p>

<p>The Absence Management module provides better management of the leave process, primarily because processes that previously varied depending on department will be tracked within a centralized area in PeopleSoft</p>

<h3>Prior To Your Assignment To PeopleSoft, What Was Your Job At UTEP?</h3>

I am an assistant director of training and special projects in Human Resource Services. I’ve been at UTEP since 2005.

<h3>What Is Your Involvement With The PeopleSoft Project?</h3>

I’m assigned as the Absence Management module SME at UTEP. I’m heavily involved with decisions concerning how the module will work at all participating institutions. Absence Management in this form will be new to UTEP, so we’re working with a blank canvas with regard to setting up the system. We’ve really had to dissect each and every component of the module to assess how it can best serve our needs.

<h3>During Your Time On The Project, What Has Surprised You Most?</h3>

It was surprising to see the varied interpretations the other UT System universities had on our State Government Codes on the different types of leaves we have available. It meant that we really had to take our time when it came to coming to a consensus on processes that will affect all of us.

<h3>What Advice Do You Have For People To Help Them Through The PeopleSoft Conversion?</h3>

Everyone can start looking at their internal processes and think about how they might handle them within each of the new modules. For example, with regard to leaves, all departments should review leave balances, making sure they are reconciled properly and keeping accurate records moving forward. In PeopleSoft, a lot of things are interconnected—meaning actions taken or data entered in one module can affect several other modules. So they’ll want to keep that in mind.

<h3>When You Were Little, What Did You Want To Be When You Grew Up?</h3>

I wanted to own a business, which is why I got my degree in business. My family came from humble beginnings—I knew what it was like to struggle when I was growing up. I just wanted to be successful on my own terms. I didn’t care how hard I had to work for that.

<em>Change is hard because people overestimate the value of what they have and underestimate the value of what they may gain by giving that up.</em>  – James Belasco and Ralph Stayer, authors of <em>Flight of the Buffalo: Soaring to Excellence, Learning to Let Employees Lead</em>.

<p>Sometimes change is easy; more often than not, it is difficult. We naturally want to hold fast to what gives us a sense of stability in life—our habits, routines, skillsets, relationships, etc. This is not to say that we don’t embrace positive change when it comes our way, or that we don’t strive to improve when given opportunities to do so. </p>

<p>What’s often hard to accept is change that we may not have chosen, especially when the benefit of that change was not immediately apparent, or if that change promised to have a significant impact on the way we work.  PeopleSoft replacing DEFINE (BIS and HRMS) is such a change.</p>

<p>By now, most of you on campus have heard of PeopleSoft and know that it will replace our legacy system for HR and Finance transactions. You have probably also heard that there is a team of people, working with teams from other UT System institutions, to ensure a smooth transition from old system to new. </p>

<p>A smooth transition is not guaranteed, however, so we ask that you keep an open mind, pay attention to the information that is shared, ask questions, and participate in focus groups, presentations, and surveys. <strong>Having a better understanding of the value and benefits of the new system will help you transition from the comfort and familiarity of the old system.</strong></p>

Want to learn more about PeopleSoft? Start with PeopleSoft terminology. We’ll define a few PeopleSoft terms in every newsletter. See more by viewing the <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/PeopleSoft%20Glossary_081512.pdf">UTEP Glossary of PeopleSoft Terms</a>.

<h3>Absence Event</h3>

The period of time that a payee (i.e., employee) is absent for the same reason. For example, if a payee is out sick Monday through Wednesday, the three-day absence is referred to as an “absence event.”

<h3>Absence Entitlement</h3>

This element in the PeopleSoft Absence Management module defines rules for granting paid time off for valid absences, such as sick time, vacation, and maternity leave. An absence entitlement element defines the entitlement amount, frequency, and entitlement period for a particular payee (i.e., employee).

<h3>Absence Administrator</h3>

The Absence Administrator will oversee the Absence Management function in PeopleSoft. In most institutions, this role will reside in HR. The Absence Manager will have the ability to make changes and corrections, if necessary. 

<h3>Accrual</h3>

In PeopleSoft, Accrual refers to the process of earning vacation or sick time. <br>
<br>
DEFINE equivalent: Accrue
