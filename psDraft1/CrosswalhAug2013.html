<h2 id="Integration">Integration Testing To Start August 26</h2>

<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/integration%20testing%20pic.jpg" alt="puzzle pieces" tilte="puzzle pieces">
August 26 marks the beginning of the Integration Testing phase of the PeopleSoft project. As you may recall, Integration Testing is the phase of testing that follows System Testing. Unlike System Testing, where business processes were tested within each module, Integration Testing will test business process transactions as they occur across modules, between both HR and Finance. “PeopleSoft is different from DEFINE in that there’s a new level of interdependencies between the modules. Transactions that occur in one module might have downstream impact on a completely different module,” says Iris Niestas, PeopleSoft project manager at UTEP. “This is a new concept for many of us on campus, so we need to test the system to make sure that we understand how it works.”

<h3>Prepping For Integration</h3>

Prior to integration testing, the project team needs to make sure that entrance criteria are met so that testing can be successful. For example, team members are validating data, ensuring that system security is working properly, testing customizations to the system, and resolving open issues.

<h3>The SWAT Team Initiative</h3>

‘SWAT’ teams, comprised of select subject matter experts (SMEs) across all participating institutions, are currently working on testing security roles that will be used for integration testing. Security roles determine what level of access end-users will have to PeopleSoft. “The issues we’ve identified so far have to do with roles not having the right level of access in place,” says Lupe Gomez, Contracts and Grants subject matter expert (SME) and project team member assigned to the security SWAT team. “It may be that a role only has access to view information, when it should also have access to add/update information as well. We’ve been able to resolve all identified issues quickly with the help of security analysts assigned to assist during security testing.” 

<h3>Payroll Parallel Testing</h3>

Payroll parallel testing is one vital component of integration testing that the project team is keeping a close eye on. During this time, three payroll runs will occur. The payroll runs will occur concurrently with Define payroll runs. Testing will verify that the payroll runs in both Define and PeopleSoft will yield the same payroll check amounts and deductions.  “We really need to make sure that we’re testing the system vigorously,” said Iris. “This phase of testing will help us to ensure that all faculty, staff, and student payroll checks will be processed accurately at go-live.”

<h2 id="Customizing">Customizing PeopleSoft Through Modifications And Interfaces</h2>

<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/Computer-Programming.jpg" alt="Code" tilte="Code">
<p>Unlike DEFINE, PeopleSoft is an “off-the-shelf” software solution for managing financial and HR transactions in large organizations. Consequently, our project team members have committed a great deal of time to understanding how PeopleSoft works, and more importantly, to finding ways to customize the system to fit the needs of all participating UT Institutions. The project team is customizing the system through modifications and interfaces, each of which go through a vetting process before being developed.</p>

<p>A modification or ‘mod’ made to PeopleSoft is a programming change that affects the way the end-user interacts with the system. If PeopleSoft’s delivered functionality is missing something that is vital to our business operations, a mod will be developed to fill the gap between what is delivered, and what we need. An example of a mod currently being developed is the HUB (historically underrepresented businesses) information tab. All participating UT System institutions identified the need for PeopleSoft to store HUB information, which was previously not a part of system functionality. The mod will fit seamlessly within PeopleSoft, allowing for HUB information to be captured within the system. That information will appear in the custom-made HUB tab.</p>

<p>A PeopleSoft interface allows for information to be passed between PeopleSoft and a 3rd party system. Interfaces build efficiency into the system as they allow for the automation of processes that would otherwise be handled manually.  An example of an interface in development is the Parking Interface. When employees select a parking permit level once a year, they can opt for a payroll deduction to occur over a specified period of time. This information is stored in our local Parking system. Through the Parking Interface, information from the Parking system files will be pushed into PeopleSoft’s Payroll module. In this way, campus users will continue to select their options for payroll deduction through the Parking system, though the deduction will be processed through the PeopleSoft Payroll module.</p>

<p>“A lot of time goes into the development of mods [and interfaces]” said Edgar Luna, UTEP IT manager for the PeopleSoft project. “But, the time spent on them is negligible in comparison to the return we’ll get in terms of efficiency and improved functionality to the system.” Developed mods and interfaces will be evaluated during integration testing, where our subject matter experts (SMEs) will be running a series of transactions to put them to the test.</p>

<h2 id="SME">SME Spotlight: Daina Llavona</h2>

<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/Daina-cropped.jpg" alt="Daina Llavona" tilte="Daina Llavona">
Daina Llavona is the subject matter expert (SME) for the PeopleSoft project overseeing the Benefits Administration module. She has a bachelor’s of computer science from UTEP and has more than 15 years of human resource experience in both the private and public sectors. Learn more about Daina and her role in the project.

<h3>Prior To Your Assignment To PeopleSoft, What Was Your Job At UTEP?</h3>

I am a benefits representative in Human Resource Services. I consult with faculty, staff, retirees, and graduate students on all benefit and retirement related matters. 

<h3>What Is Your Involvement With The PeopleSoft Project?</h3>

I am the subject matter expert (SME) assigned to working on the Benefits Administration module. A part of my duties involves ensuring that all the UT Benefits and Retirement Plans are captured and administered properly. I’ve been dedicated to the project for about 2 years.  

<h3>During Your Time On The Project, What Has Surprised You Most?</h3>

I’ve been surprised by two things: first is the level of commitment from the project team; second is the amount of detail that goes into a project of this size. Not only do we have to take into account the processes that occur within our module, but also how those behind-the-scenes processes impact other modules.  

<h3>What Advice Do You Have For People To Help Them Through The PeopleSoft Conversion?</h3>

I’d remind them that this is a great opportunity to learn a new system, and enhance their current job skills. Also, to be open-minded and ask lots and lots of questions!

<h3>When You Were Little, What Did You Want To Be When You Grew Up?</h3>

When I was a little girl, I wanted to be a nurse like my godmother. I would practice by ‘taking care’ of my pets and making sure they were healthy. Now, here I am in the area of benefits! Being in HR Benefits allows me the opportunity to interact and assist our employees with their benefits needs.

<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/Benefits-image.jpg" alt="Benefits" tilte="Benefits">
<p>Benefits Administration is the PeopleSoft module that manages the administration of multiple benefits programs, employee life events, and retirement plans. As with many other PeopleSoft modules, transactions in Benefits Administration will impact other modules. For example, an employee’s benefit elections and rates will feed into the deductions that occur in Payroll. </p>

<p>For the most part, transactions that occur between modules will take place behind the scenes. According to Daina Llavona, the PeopleSoft subject matter expert (SME) overseeing the Benefits Administration module, employees shouldn’t see many differences in the way they make their benefits elections once we go-live. Interfaces will be in place that will allow users to continue using My UT Benefits for their annual enrollment of benefits and Retirement Manager for optional retirement programs.</p>

“The PS Employee Self-Service page will contain the links to My UT Benefits and UT Retirement for easy access. Employees will not see any major differences in how they make their benefits elections, as most of the changes with the new system will impact back-office processes,” Daina said. “So, our back-office staff will need to learn the new processes, but for everyone else it should be business as usual with regard to benefits.”
