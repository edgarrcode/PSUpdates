<h2 id="Serve">Serve Yourself!</h2>

<p>As we get closer to the launch date for PeopleSoft (September 1, 2013), you will begin to hear the terms “Employee Self Service” and “Manager Self Service” more often. While different modules in PeopleSoft will be used heavily by employees in the processing units of Human Resources and Financial Services, most employees on campus will interact with PeopleSoft only through Employee Self Service. Managers and those who supervise other employees will also use Manager Self Service.</p>

<h3>So, What Is Employee Self Service And How Will You Use It?</h3>

<p>Employee Self Service will essentially replace UT Direct for access to your employee and personal data and allow you to apply for jobs that are posted. Instead of logging into UT Direct, you will log in to PeopleSoft. You will be able to find and view your pay check stubs, update direct deposit information, update your W-4 and obtain your W-2.  You will be able to view and make changes to your personal information, such as addresses, phone numbers, marital status and complete the I-9 form (employment eligibility form). Additionally, you will use Employee Self Service to submit your electronic leave requests and submit your timesheet (if you are an hourly employee). Not all employees will need to submit a timesheet, and some, such as Facilities employees, will continue to use their current system to log their time. </p>

<p>According to Irma Lopez, associate director in HR and the PeopleSoft Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the HR module, Employee Self Service will be a “one stop shop” for employees.</p>

<h3>What About Manager Self Service?</h3>

<p>As with Employee Self Service, managers will log in to Manager Self Service through the PeopleSoft portal. Using PeopleSoft’s web-based management tools, you can perform tasks such as approving timesheets and leave requests, entering leave requests on behalf of employees, and reviewing and approving expense reports. Managers will also be able to delegate some tasks when they are out of the office or otherwise unavailable. </p>

<p>“Manager Self Service will make it very convenient for managers to perform these tasks. In essence, they will have all information at their fingertips to approve actions and to keep the process moving smoothly,” says Andrew Peña, director of HR and PeopleSoft Subject Matter Expert for Recruiting.</p>

<h3>Choosing Employee Self Service Or Manager Self Service From The Main Menu In PeopleSoft</h3>

<h2 id="ModuleSpotlight">Module Spotlight: Accounts Payable</h2>
<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/accountspayable.jpg" alt="Module Spotlight: Travel & Expense" Title="Module Spotlight: Travel & Expense">

<p>Accounts Payable (AP) is the PeopleSoft module that the university will use for processing non-PO payments. “Payables, is payables, is payables,” said René Rayón, the PeopleSoft team member in charge of overseeing the AP module. “The principles of payables won’t change, just the system that manages the process.”</p>

<p>We will continue to use Miner Mall once we go live. Users familiar with Miner Mall will be happy to hear that they will continue to use it for Purchase Order (PO) payments. A third-party interface will be in place to pass information from Miner Mall to PeopleSoft. The main change in payment processing will be for non-PO payments. Users will enter non-PO payments into PeopleSoft. According to René, the new process will be easy to learn. “The screens that employees will have to use in PeopleSoft are straight forward. The actual routing process will be similar to what we currently have in DEFINE,” said René.</p>

<p>One feature of PeopleSoft that users will find helpful is its robust search tool.  When a user needs to make a non-PO payment through PeopleSoft, they will be able to search for vendors in multiple ways. “People will find a method that works best for them, using the key search features that are available.”</p>

<h3>Example Of Search Feature In Vendor Information Screen</h3>
<img style="border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/MSS_edit.png" alt="PeopleSoft Screenshot" Title="PeopleSoft Screenshot">

<p>Another feature of PeopleSoft that users will appreciate is the ability to attach scanned documents to their vouchers. In the AP side of PeopleSoft, there are more opportunities to attach documents that are needed for processing. Documents can more easily be reviewed, which will help to eliminate delays in payment and reduce the environmental burden of extra paper.</p>

<h2 id="ModuleSpotlight2">Module Spotlight: Travel & Expense</h2>
<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/SMCRVA-Travel-Panel.jpg" alt="Glossary" Title="Glossary">

<p>Travel & Expense is the PeopleSoft module that will be used to handle travel authorizations, travel advances, and reimbursements for travel or other employee-related expenses.</p>

<p>Having travel processes and expense processes housed in the same module will enhance the flow of information between the two sets of processes—something that was previously limited in DEFINE. For example, in PeopleSoft, once a travel authorization is created for an employee, the employee can request a travel advance. Once an employee initiates the travel reimbursement process, they can match their travel advance to their expenses. To get the same outcome, the current process requires cancelling and reissuing payments. </p>

<p>As in the AP module, there are several ways to find information when prompted by the system. For example, users will also no longer have to remember the object codes to select their expense types. A drop-down menu will provide a textual description of different possible expense types that they can choose from.</p>

<h2 id="SME">SME Spotlight: René Rayón</h2>

René Rayón is the subject matter expert (SME) for the PeopleSoft project overseeing the Accounts Payable and Travel & Expense modules. He has a bachelor of business administration (accountancy) from UTEP and more than 30 years of accounting experience in both the private and public sectors. Learn more about René and his role in the project.

<h3>Prior To Your Assignment To PeopleSoft, What Was Your Job At UTEP?</h3>

I managed the Accounts Payable Department for the university. That involved supervising staff responsible for processing payments for PO and non-PO vouchers, Travel Card and ProCard payments, and employee travel and expense reimbursements. I began working at UTEP in 2000.

<h3>What Is Your Involvement With The PeopleSoft Project?</h3>

I’m the SME for both the Travel & Expense and Accounts Payable modules. I’m part of a team that is configuring the system that six universities and UT System will be using for their accounts payables and travel processes. This includes defining PeopleSoft processes related to the Pro Card, Travel Card payments and reimbursements for individuals and their travel expenses. 

<h3>During Your Time On The Project, What Has Surprised You Most?</h3>

It was surprising to see how each financial reporting group worked differently with their IT departments. We have a great relationship between both groups here at UTEP.  Our IT group’s reporting structure allows them to be heavily involved with not only the academic side of UTEP, but also the business side. We can reach out to them whenever we have an issue. We show them what we want to do, they respond, and we accomplish things together. They do a great job and are very involved with this conversion.  

<h3>What Advice Do You Have For People To Help Them Through The PeopleSoft Conversion?</h3>

My advice is to keep an open mind. We’re looking at a totally different system that we need to learn. It’s going to take time to see how things work. We will need to review and make changes to some of our procedures and become familiar with the capabilities of the system.

<h3>When You Were Little, What Did You Want To Be When You Grew Up?</h3>

First I wanted to be a fireman and then I wanted to be a baseball player. I became interested in accounting after learning about it from my friend’s dad, who was an accountant at White Sands. It sounded like a good profession. For the most part, what we do day-to-day doesn’t involve critical math—it involves a lot of decision making.

Want to learn more about PeopleSoft? Start with PeopleSoft terminology. We’ll define a few PeopleSoft terms in every newsletter. See more by viewing the <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/PeopleSoft%20Glossary_081512.pdf">UTEP Glossary of PeopleSoft Terms</a>.

<h3>Wildcards</h3>

A wildcard is a symbol that can be used to search for an item for which you only have partial information. In PeopleSoft, the wildcard symbol is the percent sign (%). Entering “BOB%” into a search field will show all entries that begin with “BOB.”

<h3>Travel Authorization</h3>

The PeopleSoft transaction (and/or the accompanying document) that places an encumbrance against the budget in anticipation of a planned trip. An approved travel authorization is a prerequisite for receiving a travel advance.

<h3>Expense Type</h3>

A field in PeopleSoft that is used to describe the type of expense incurred in an expense report. A textual description of the expense type can be selected from a drop-down menu. Previously in DEFINE, object codes were used to select the expense type.

<h3>SpeedChart</h3>

A speedchart is a shortcut used to populate a combination of chartfields. Speedcharts are used in creating transactions.
