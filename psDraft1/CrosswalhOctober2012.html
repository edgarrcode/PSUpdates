<h2 id="WhatISPSSec">What Is PeopleSoft Anyway?</h2>
<p>Most of campus has been hearing about PeopleSoft for over a year now. Still, many of you may be asking, “What is PeopleSoft anyway?”</p>

<h3>PeopleSoft Is An ERP System.</h3>

 <p>At UTEP and other UT System schools that are converting, PeopleSoft will replace our legacy DEFINE system for all finance (BIS) and human resources (HRMS) processes. PeopleSoft is designed to help large enterprises better manage their resources, business processes, and data. Some benefits of deploying an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system like PeopleSoft in a university environment include facilitating the flow of information among all business functions within a large organization; improved controls and program alerts (for example, to prevent overspending or underspending on project budgets); and encouraging new business processes that are more efficient over time.</p>

<h3>Doesn’t DEFINE Do All That For Us Now?</h3>

 <p>“Yes and no,” says Cindy Villa, vice president for business affairs at UTEP and chair of the executive committee leading the PeopleSoft implementation on campus. “DEFINE is a legacy system that has served our HR and finance needs well over the past 21 years. But, as the University of Texas System looks at the challenges involved in managing such a large enterprise in the future and UTEP makes strides toward becoming a national research university, we know we must build a data management infrastructure that is capable of addressing continuous innovations in technology quickly and seamlessly. As a commercial product, PeopleSoft can do that better than a legacy system.”</p>

<p>With the PeopleSoft implementation being regarded as an important element in UTEP’s advance toward Tier One status, identifying how best to use the system is essential. While PeopleSoft is considered a state-of-the-art productivity tool, it won’t solve all issues, especially right off the bat.  That’s because it is designed to apply industry standard “best practices” to key business processes. “PeopleSoft will not provide instant solutions to some of the issues you deal with now in the DEFINE system,” says Letitia Andrews, PeopleSoft technical trainer at UT Dallas, which converted to PeopleSoft in 2011, “especially if you try to simply recreate DEFINE business processes in the new PeopleSoft model. The work your campuses are doing now to identify improvements to current processes will serve you well when the system goes live.”</p>

<h3>Will Converting From DEFINE To PeopleSoft Be Easy?</h3>

 <p>“No,” says Carlos Hernandez, controller and associate vice president for finance for the University of North Texas, which converted to PeopleSoft in 2005. Formerly the associate vice president for finance and comptroller at UTEP, Dr. Hernandez is in a unique position to comment on how implementation might affect our campus. “Having trained people to use both DEFINE and PeopleSoft…I can say that both systems are complex and will take time to learn. Most people will find that PeopleSoft is easier to navigate, once they learn the basic navigation structure, as the system uses drop-down menus and plain English, rather than the command codes of DEFINE.”</p>

<h3>The Bottom Line.</h3>

 <p>Tessy Rappé, director of accounting and business services and associate comptroller, says, “if you’ve worked at UTEP long enough, you remember the move to DEFINE in 1991. While it wasn’t easy, it was necessary at the time to keep up with the data management needs of the University and UT System. As we continue to evolve as an educational institution, the move to PeopleSoft is just another step in our progression toward achieving our goal of becoming a Tier One University.”</p>

<h2 id="EndDateSec">UTEP Does Not Have An End Date</h2>
<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/change-ahead-sign.jpg" alt="Change Ahead Road Sign" Title="Change Ahead Road Sign">

<p>Someone once said, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Later, someone else said, “If not now, when?”  Opinion continues to fluctuate over what anyone can hope to achieve through change. In light of our transition to PeopleSoft, now seems like a fitting time to thoughtfully consider where we collectively fall on the perception-of-change scale. Whether change is embraced or rejected, the push and pull of these sentiments will impact the success of our transition to PeopleSoft. </p>


<p>As UTEP continues to grow and change, so will the many components that make it a vibrant and relevant learning community. The change to PeopleSoft is in progress, but there are a number of other campus projects that are in different stages of development. Some are just beginning, and others are drawing to a close. At whatever point they are, the constant movement and activity should remind us of one important point: UTEP does not have an end date. There is no checkbox that we will mark “done,” just as there is no dust that we can figuratively wipe off our hands. Years and years down the line, even PeopleSoft may become obsolete—replaced by something that better fits the needs of a future university. </p>

<p>It is only natural to initially reject pending changes; but, most of us would probably agree that change is necessary. After all, the need for change is what brought UTEP into existence in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="ModuleSpotlightSec">Module Spotlight: Payroll And Time & Labor</h2>

<p>Payroll and Time & Labor are two modules in PeopleSoft that work together to accurately calculate employees’ time and manage employees’ pay. Time & Labor serves as the time reporting system, which is fully integrated with Payroll. Why is this important? The main benefit of the new system, according to Olaya Hernandez, the PeopleSoft team member overseeing the configuration of these two modules for UTEP, is that it will help us to standardize the timesheet process for all UTEP employees.</p>

<p>The timekeeping process in PeopleSoft is wholly online, for both hourly and full-time employees. This will streamline the process for hourly employees, although the impact on full-time employees will be minimal.</p>

<h3>Here Is An Example Of What Our Online Timesheets Might Look Like.</h3>

<h3>What Is Your REAL Job At UTEP (When You Are Not On The PeopleSoft Project)?</h3>

I am an assistant director of Business Services, overseeing Payroll and Accounts Payable. I’ve been at UTEP for 13 years, starting out as a work-study student in the Payroll office.

<h3>What Is Your Role On The PeopleSoft Project?</h3>

I am part of the Payroll and Time & Labor functional committees and serve as a co-chair for both modules. I am the UTEP representative on these committees along with representatives from each of the other UT Share schools. Our role is to work with our CCI consultants to configure both modules to best serve our needs. Because PeopleSoft is an integrated ERP system, we must work closely with our counterparts at other institutions (on our functional committees) and also with our fellow SMEs in other modules here at UTEP to make sure the system is configured correctly across all modules.  

<h3>When You Were Little, What Did You Want To Be When You Grew Up?</h3>

I wanted to be a cashier! My grandmother owned a little corner store and I was in the store with her from the time I was a small child. I was fascinated by the idea of using the cash register and counting the money.  

<h3>What Advice Do You Have For People To Help Them Through The PeopleSoft Conversion?</h3>

<p>I would urge people to be patient. We are working very hard to configure the system for our specific needs. Our priority is to make sure that our employees are paid accurately and on time, regardless of our accounting system.</p>

<p>Olaya assures us that everyone will receive their paycheck when PeopleSoft goes live!</p>

<h2 id="DataValSec">Data Validation And Conversion: No Bugs Please!</h2>
<img style="float:right; width:35%; border:1px solid #ddd; padding:3px; margin:0 0 20px 30px;" src="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/BugsApple_small.jpg" alt="Bugs in apple" Title="Bugs in apple">

During the week of September 17, UTEP sent a team of four to Fort Worth to join other UT Share team members for data validation and conversion training. The point of data validation is to make sure that DEFINE data can be converted successfully to PeopleSoft. The data validation team spent two days learning how to identify and track “bugs” that may cause problems during data conversion. Our own Gabe Lopez, HR analyst, led the pack with the first bug discovered and received an honorary “bug” award.  Data validation and conversion will continue for several more weeks.

<h3>What Can You Do To Prepare?</h3>

<p>Many of you are anxious to do what you can to help prepare for the upcoming conversion. We are in the process of analyzing and preparing our current system data for conversion.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks and months, the PeopleSoft team will be reaching out to you to ask for your assistance in various areas relating to data cleanup. Data cleanup is simply the process of making sure the digital information stored in our systems is accurate and up to date. After all, we do not want to convert “bad data” when we make the move to PeopleSoft!</p>

<p>Here is just a sample of the data types we will be asking for your assistance with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Position data </li>
    <li>Department and Unit codes </li>
    <li>Leave balances </li>
    <li>Employee information </li>
</ul>
