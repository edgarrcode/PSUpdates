<h2 class="aTitle"><span>Come Explore UTEP's newest dining experience.<br><i class="caption" style="color:red;">[beginning date]</i></span></h2>
<p>With longer operating hours and a variety of food options, the newest restaurant on campus will offer students an additional choice alongside national brands such as Starbucks and Jamba Juice. </p>
<p>Whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner there will be something for everyone.</p>

<h2 class="aTitle"><span>What's Coming?</span></h2>
<p>The University of Texas at El Paso is expanding its dining choices to encompass a brand-new meal plan option. Beginning fall 2015, this meal plan will combine the feel of a fast-casual restaurant with the affordability and choice you have come to expect from UTEP Food Services.</p>
<p>The meal plan will be available in a newly constructed dining area on the second floor of Union Building East. The meal plan permits you to enjoy a variety of foods that are fresh, made daily and all-you-care-to-eat.  </p>
<p>There will be several plans for purchase, but all of them will be on your Miner Gold Card. Purchasing the meal plan in advance will save you 30 percent as compared to buying it at the door. </p>
<p>[insert plans once they are approved]</p>
<p>The Miner Meal Program will continue and still provide a 10 percent discount participating locations on campus. </p>

<h2 class="aTitle"><span>What will the new restaurant offer? </span></h2>
<p>The new, all-you-can-eat restaurant will have a rotating menu with comfort food favorites, international cuisines, and a salad bar. Beverages will be included. </p>
<p><span style="color:red;">[ephasis these vegan options]</span></p>
<p>There will be more vegetarian and vegan options, as well as gluten- and allergen-free foods.</p>
<p>Dining choices will be linked to My Fitness Pal and the Wellness Center's I Pick Wellness program so you can make better decisions when it comes to your food.</p>


<h2 class="aTitle"><span>Miner Swipes</span></h2>
<p>There is a meal plan to fit every Miner's needs. Using your Miner Gold Card, each entrance into the restaurant will deduct one "swipe" from your plan.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>
<p>Students may purchase meal plans that range between 5 swipes per week and an unlimited number of swipes per week. Those living in the residence halls will find our Miner Platinum plan most cost-efficient. </p>
<p>Students who commute or spend fewer days on campus will find our Miner Flex plans provide them with the most choice.</p>
<p>Swipes for students do not roll over from week to week and are nontransferable.</p>

<h3>Faculty and Staff</h3>
<p>Faculty and staff may purchase swipes in packages starting at 25 swipes per semester. </p>
<p>Swipes for faculty and staff do not roll over from semester to semester and are nontransferable.</p>
<p>To purchase a Meal Plan, stop by the Mike Loya Academic Service Building, room 116 or call 747-7334.</p>
