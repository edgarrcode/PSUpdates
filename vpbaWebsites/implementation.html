                <p>The main idea of this implementation process is that we create a product that gives site owners full control to create and build their site.</p>
                <p>The product consists on the themes and templates that we will create, and a “Prebuilt Demo Website” configured in the most common way.</p>
                <p>In summary this is the process: we install the demo web site for site owners to use as a starting point; the site owners have full control to manage the content of their sites; we provide full support of our product to the site owners.</p>
                <p>The main advantage of this solution is scalability. We can delegate the responsibility of creating and maintaining the websites to the site owners. For example, instead of us making 100 websites, we can have 100 site owners creating their own website. However, in order for this to work, we need a good product (themes/templates), and provide good guidance and support.</p>
