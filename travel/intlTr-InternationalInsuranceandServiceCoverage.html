                    <p>With few exceptions described below the following services and insurances are in place for international travelers regardless of whether or not they are traveling to a destination with a Travel Warning. While it is true, by requesting an exception to the international travel policy, the traveler does bear a greater assumption of risk that does not mean that the traveler is not insured. There are several components to the coverage, both insurance and non-insurance, as described below. </p>

                    <h3>Non-insurance coverage</h3>
                    <p>International SOS – the services provided by International SOS are many. However, for the purposes of the question posed, the most relevant information is that they can help locate reputable medical facilities, and they can repatriate either living or deceased travelers if the need arises.</p>

                    <h3>Insurance Coverage:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Foreign Workers’ Compensation Policy – provides coverage for compensable injuries sustained while traveling. There are only four destinations that are excluded from coverage: Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and North Korea. While travel to North Korea is strictly prohibited, we must seek prior approval from the insurance carrier for any traveler traveling to one of the other three countries listed above in order to get quotes for additional premium to add coverage.</li>
                        <li>Blue Cross Blue Shield – for non-compensable illnesses while traveling abroad. BCBS provides worldwide coverage. It is imperative for each individual traveler to understand their coverage and recommended that each traveler contact BCBS prior to traveling to ensure they fully understand the process should they need to use their personal medical insurance.</li>
                        <li>Other personal health insurance plans – This would be relevant for individuals who opt out of BCBS because they have other medical coverage. It is imperative for each individual traveler to understand their coverage and recommended that each traveler contact their carrier prior to traveling to ensure they fully understand the process should they need to use their personal medical insurance.</li>
                        <li>UT System Foreign Insurance Package includes general liability coverage as well as WCI should a covered event occur where the claim is a liability claim rather than a medical claim.</li>
                    </ul>
