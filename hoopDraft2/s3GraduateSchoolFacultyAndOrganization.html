<hr>
<h2>3.2 Graduate Faculty </h2>
<p>The University will have a Graduate Faculty composed of persons qualified by their scholarly or creative works and effectiveness in the teaching of graduate students.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>3.2.1 Composition</h3>
    <p>The University tenured or tenure track faculty member who holds an appointment in a department or comparable unit conducting a doctoral or master's program and who is, or on appointment will be, a participant in such a program becomes a member of the Graduate Faculty of the University upon certification as specified in 3.5.2 below. Faculty members holding positions within a department that does not have an active graduate program, but who are participants in joint graduate programs, will likewise be certified as specified in 3.5.2 below. Non-tenure track faculty, adjunct faculty, part-time faculty, visiting scholars, UTEP professional staff members, and post doctoral fellows are not eligible for regular Graduate Faculty membership, but may contribute to the graduate program under temporary appointment as specified in 3.2.4 below.</p>

    <h3>3.2.2 Privileges and Responsibilities </h3>
    <p>Regular Graduate Faculty will have the following privileges and responsibilities:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>May direct doctoral dissertations and chair doctoral committees;</li>
        <li>May serve on doctoral committees;</li>
        <li>May direct master's theses and serve on master's thesis committees;</li>
        <li>May teach graduate courses;</li>
        <li>Will be members of their departmental graduate studies committees with full voting privileges;</li>
        <li>May be elected to the Graduate Council;</li>
        <li>Will have full voting privileges on matters before the Graduate Assembly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>3.2.3 Criteria for Membership </h3>
    <p>The general qualifications for membership in the Graduate Faculty are appropriate educational qualifications and demonstrated research performance or creative works, and satisfactory graduate teaching. In order to be eligible for appointment,</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>there must be submitted on behalf of the applicant evidence of achieved appropriate educational qualifications and demonstrated research performance or creative works or, where applicable, significant professional activities supporting his/her field of teaching; and</li>
        <li>upon receipt of this application, there must be an evaluation of the applicant's contribution or potential for contribution to the graduate program by his/her departmental graduate committee. A department may adopt added requirements for faculty under its jurisdiction. Such requirements must be first ratified by the Graduate Council.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a professional or clinical program is offered by a department, the department may propose special standards for evaluating an applicant's qualifications to participate in the graduate program. The standards, which must reflect accepted requirements in professional schools and departments in major universities, must be approved by the Graduate Council.</p>
    <p>A minimum of three members is required for a departmental graduate committee to evaluate its own Members. If a department fails to meet this minimum, the Chair or Program Director and Academic Dean will appoint additional evaluators to achieve that number, and such resulting ad hoc committee shall be identified on the application.</p>

    <h3>3.2.4 Temporary Graduate Program Participation</h3>
    <p>Upon recommendation by the appropriate departmental committee and approval by the Dean of the Graduate School, other persons may be assigned to teach graduate courses or serve as member, but not chair, of thesis and dissertation committees for the duration specified in the appointment.  Non-tenure track faculty, adjunct faculty, part-time faculty, visiting scholars, UTEP professional staff members, and post doctoral fellows may be appointed, usually on a one-academic-year basis, upon approval of the departmental or program graduate committee, the chair or director, the Academic Dean, and the Dean of the Graduate School.  Such an appointee must be qualified for membership by virtue of academic background and experience, and satisfy other appropriate criteria, such as scholarly achievement, research proficiency, or artistic recognition relevant to the specific course assignment or research committee appointment.  Exceptional cases, as may be determined at the discretion of the Dean of the Graduate School, will be submitted to the Graduate Council for approval.</p>

<h2>3.3 Organization</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">

    <h3>3.3.1 Graduate Bodies </h3>
    <p>The Graduate Faculty of The University of Texas at El Paso will exercise its legislative functions through a Graduate Assembly. This body will be the final faculty authority for recommending policies concerned with academic aspects of the graduate program, such as setting minimum standards for admission and retention of students, and for furthering the development of the graduate program.</p>
    <div class="subSection Level4">


        <p><strong>3.3.1.1</strong> The Graduate Assembly will consist of all Members of the Graduate Faculty, with vote, and ex-officio members without vote. Ex-officio members will include the President, the Provost, the Dean of the Graduate School, and other Deans of Colleges who have not previously been approved as members of the Assembly.</p>
   
        <p>Meetings of the Graduate Assembly will be called by the Chair upon recommendation of the Graduate Council, the Dean of the Graduate School, or by petition of 10 members of the Assembly.</p>
    
        <p>The Graduate Assembly will elect a chair from among its voting membership to serve a two-year term. The Assembly may create such standing or ad hoc committees as are necessary as long as these are not duplicative of committees already under the auspices of the Faculty Senate. The Graduate Assembly will establish such procedures as are necessary for it to fulfill its function. Questions of duplication or jurisdiction of committees will be addressed by a joint meeting of the Graduate Council and the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->

    <h3>3.3.2 Graduate Council </h3>
    <p>There will be an elected Graduate Council, a body whose major purpose will be to serve as the administrative arm of the Graduate Assembly.</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>This Council will have 18 voting members. Seventeen of that number will include the Chair of the Graduate Assembly, two from each college, and four at large. In order to better coordinate faculty governance of graduate education, the remaining voting member will be the President of the Faculty Senate.</li>
        <li>One graduate student of the University of Texas at El Paso may be elected by graduate students to serve as a non-voting student representative to the Graduate Council.</li>
        <li>Members of the Graduate Council, excluding the Chair of the Graduate Assembly and the Chair of the Faculty Senate, will serve three-year terms. The terms shall be staggered so that approximately 1/3 of the Council shall be elected each year.</li>
        <li>To be eligible for the Council, a member must have a total of three yearsâ experience as a graduate faculty member at U.T. El Paso or other universities.</li>
        <li>Members of the Council will not serve consecutively for more than two terms.</li>
        <li>The Dean of the Graduate School will be responsible for conducting the elections. Only members of a particular college may vote for the representative of that college. Consistent with the limitations stated in these Bylaws, candidates obtaining the largest pluralities shall be elected to the Council.</li>
        <li>To appear on the ballot, a member must be nominated by five members. For a college representative, the nominating members must be from the college.</li>
        <li>The elections will take place before May 1, and terms will begin on the following September 1.</li>
        <li>The Dean of the Graduate School will be an ex-officio member with no vote.</li>
        <li>The Graduate Council will hold regularly-scheduled open meetings. Agenda for all open meetings will be distributed to all members of the Graduate Council one week prior to any meeting. Additional meetings of the Council may be called by the Dean of the Graduate School or the Chair of the Graduate Council.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>3.3.3 Chair of the Graduate Assembly </h3>
    <p>The Chair of the Graduate Assembly will automatically be the Chair of the Graduate Council. To better coordinate faculty governance of graduate education, the Chair of the Graduate Assembly will also automatically serve as a voting member of the Faculty Senate Executive Committee. The Chair of the Graduate Assembly will represent the Graduate Faculty at all appropriate academic functions. The Council will elect a Secretary from its voting membership. The Council will elect one member to represent the Graduate Council as an ex-officio member of the Faculty Senate Committee on Committees. The Council may create such standing or ad hoc committees as are necessary. The Graduate Council will establish such procedures as are necessary for it to fulfill its function. Each year the Chair of the Graduate Council will present a summary of the actions of the Council to the Graduate Assembly and at a meeting of the Faculty Senate.</p>

    <h3>3.3.4 Committees on Graduate Studies</h3>
    <p>The University of Texas at El Paso will establish a Departmental or Program Committee on Graduate Studies in any academic area in which an approved graduate program is offered. The Committee will consist of all members of the Graduate Faculty in the department of the program, and a minimum of three members is required. A committee may include members from several allied disciplines if this seems most effective in stimulating development. Members of the Graduate Faculty who are retired or on modified service may serve as members of the committee but without vote. Each committee will select its Chair.</p>

    <p>The Department of Program Committees on Graduate Studies will be charged with the overall responsibility for the operation of graduate programs, including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Graduate Faculty membership;</li>
        <li>New degree programs;</li>
        <li>Graduate course offerings;</li>
        <li>Graduate catalog listings and up-dating; and</li>
        <li>Review of course objectives for graduate courses.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>These recommendations will be transmitted through normal channels.</p>

    <p>Each Departmental or Program Committee on Graduate Studies is responsible for recommending the admission to candidacy for all graduate degrees in its academic area.</p>

    <p>Until there is a Committee on Graduate Studies for an academic area in which graduate work is offered, a Committee of the Graduate Assembly appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School in consultation with the appropriate Academic Dean shall perform the duties of a Committee on Graduate Studies.</p>

    <h3>3.3.5 Graduate Advisors </h3>
    <p>The Graduate Advisor(s) in each Department will be appointed by the Departmental or Program Committee on Graduate Studies with the approval of the Department Chair, or Program Director, the Dean of the Academic College, and the Dean of the Graduate School. The term of office of the Graduate Advisor(s) will be determined by the Departmental Committee on Graduate Studies.</p>

    <p>The Graduate Advisor(s) will:</p>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>Represent the Graduate School and the Committee on Graduate Studies in all matters pertaining to the advising of graduate students taking major work in that academic discipline;</li>
        <li>Advise each graduate student on registration, adds, drops, section changes, and special examinations;</li>
        <li>Maintain a record of each student's work for previous degrees along with copies of registrations and grades in work at this University;</li>
        <li>Refer students to the Graduate School for exceptions;</li>
        <li>Inform students and prospective students about graduate work and refer students in appropriate instances to other faculty members for advice.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>3.4 Graduate Program Modifications</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">

<h3>3.4.1 Existing Programs</h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>3.4.1.1</strong> New Courses - Existing Programs. A department or program wishing to incorporate a new course into an existing program must submit through its Departmental or Program Committee for Graduate Studies a catalog description and justification for the course to the Graduate Council. A primary consideration of the Council in this matter is to determine that such requests do not involve unnecessary redundancy.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4.1.2</strong> New Options - Existing Degree Programs. Changes in the elective options under existing degree programs must be approved by the graduate committee of the individual department. The proposal should then be forwarded to Graduate Council through the normal channels. The Graduate Council will have the responsibility to review all new elective options on the basis of the following standards:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>The adequacy of library and other institutional resources for the implementation of the courses required in the elective option.</li>
            <li>The availability of qualified faculty to administer the proposed option without harming the capability to offer existing graduate and undergraduate degree programs.</li>
            <li>The justification for offering such a degree option based upon the availability of employment opportunities for graduates and/or any other appropriate rationale for the adoption of the option.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>3.4.1.3</strong> Course Deletions</p>
        <p>The Departmental or Program Graduate Committees will notify the Graduate Council of their intention to recommend deletion of any graduate course.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.4.1.4</strong> Undergraduate Courses for Graduate Credit</p>
        <p>The Departmental or Program Graduate Studies Committee will submit for Graduate Council approval any undergraduate courses that are to be used for credit toward its graduate program(s).</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->

    <h3>3.4.2 New Graduate Degrees </h3>
    <p>Proposals for new graduate degree programs will be forwarded through the Academic Dean and the Dean of the Graduate School to the Graduate Council. The Council will consider all relevant criteria, and may recommend revisions to strengthen the proposal as necessary before making a recommendation to the UTEP administration.</p>

    <h3>3.4.3 Review of Existing Graduate Programs </h3>
    <p>All departments offering graduate programs will have those programs reviewed on a periodic basis. The Graduate Council will establish guidelines, procedures, and committee structures for conducting the review.</p>
    <p>The Dean of the Graduate School will be responsible for establishing a calendar for the periodic review of a department's graduate activities. To the extent possible, reviews will coincide in time and be integrated with reviews of the department's program(s) for other purposes, such as accreditation, preparation of new degree proposals, or carrying out legislative, Coordinating Board, or UT System mandates. Collaborative efforts will be pursued between the Dean of the Graduate School, the Dean of the Academic College, and University Administration to conduct reviews of any existing undergraduate programs in the same area as the graduate activities being reviewed. At the discretion of the Graduate Council or upon recommendation of the Dean of the Graduate School, in consultation with the appropriate Academic Dean, a department's graduate activities may be re-evaluated more frequently.</p>
</div><!-- Level3 -->

<hr>
<h2>3.5 Operating Procedures</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>3.5.1 General Principles</h3>
    <p>Each department will assume responsibility for all graduate programs within its area or interdisciplinary program unit. In general, the flow of information between the department or program and the Graduate Council will be from the Departmental or Program Graduate Committee on Graduate Studies, through the Department Chair or Program Director, the Academic Dean, to the Dean of the Graduate School and Graduate Council. Recommendations of the Graduate Council or the Graduate Assembly will be submitted through the Graduate School to the President of the University and such other persons or bodies as required by The Regentsâ Rules and Regulations. The above channels will be utilized for new courses, degree requirements, options, and new degree programs. It is understood that the word "through" in the above statement will mean that all documents will be forwarded with such recommendations as each person may make.</p>

    <h3>3.5.2 Appointment & Removal of Members </h3>
    
    <p>Member applications will originate with the Departmental or Program Committee on Graduate Studies and will be transmitted through the Department Chair or Program Director and the Academic Dean to the Graduate School. Either the Dean of the Graduate School or the applicant may request a review of the application by the Graduate Council.</p>
    
    <p>Appointment of a Member will be effected when recommended by the Departmental or Program Graduate Studies Committee, the Department Chair or Program Director, and the Dean of the Academic College. If appointment is not recommended by the Graduate Studies Committee, the Department Chair, Program Director or the Academic Dean, and the applicant wishes to appeal the decision, a review of the application for appointment will be conducted by the Graduate Council, and a recommendation of appointment or denial will be made.</p>
    
    <p>Member applications from faculty members in departments that do not have departmental committees will originate with a Departmental or Program Committee on Graduate Studies involved with any joint graduate programs in which the faculty member intends to participate or with the Graduate School.
    In all cases where an appealed application for Member status is denied by the Council, the reasons for the denial will be stated by the Graduate Council and will be transmitted to the applicant.
    Members may be removed upon recommendation by the appropriate Departmental or Program Graduate Studies Committee through the Department Chair or Program Director, and Academic Dean, to the Dean of the Graduate School. Appeal of removal may be made to the Graduate Council.</p>
    
    <p>In all cases where any request of a Departmental or Program Graduate Studies Committee is denied, the reasons for the denial will be stated by the Graduate Council, and will be transmitted to the Departmental or Program Committee and Academic Dean.</p>

    <p><strong>3.5.3</strong> All meetings of the Graduate Assembly and Graduate Council will be conducted according to Robert's Rules of Order (newly revised).</p>
    <p><strong>3.5.4</strong> Revisions and changes in these bylaws may be recommended by the Graduate Assembly. Voting will be permitted by mail ballot, and decisions will be made by two-thirds of those voting.</p>
    
    <p>Approved amendments shall be forwarded under the provisions of, Section I, Chapter 2.3.3.2 of this Handbook</p>
