    <h3>12.5.2 Notice Requirement</h3>

    <h3>12.6.4 No Automatic Disqualification</h3>
    <p>The University does not automatically disqualify all applicants or current employees with a criminal background from employment or continued employment. In the event the investigation reveals a criminal background, the hiring official and/or the divisional Vice President when a current employee, must consult with the Office of Human Resource Services in these circumstances and determine, on a case by case basis, whether the individual is qualified based on factors such as:</p>
