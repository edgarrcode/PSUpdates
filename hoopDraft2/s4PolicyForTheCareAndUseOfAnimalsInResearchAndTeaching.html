<h2>8.1 Institutional Responsibility </h2>

<h2>8.2 Institutional Policy</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <p><strong>8.2.1</strong> All research sponsored by or conducted at the University involving vertebrate animals, whether funded or non-funded, conducted by faculty, students, staff, using any property or facility owned or controlled by the University will be conducted in compliance with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and all other applicable federal statues, regulations and policies.”  Research involving vertebrate animals will not be conducted unless the requirements of these federal requirements have been satisfied and written certification of the University’s review and approval of the research is obtained. </p>
    <p><strong>8.2.2</strong> All requests for vertebrate animal use will be submitted as a proposal and reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).  Research involving animals is not permitted to begin until the IACUC has approved the research proposal. </p>
    <p><strong>8.2.3</strong> This policy applies to all research involving vertebrate animal subjects, regardless of sponsorship, if: </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The research is approved by the institution’s IACUC; or </li>
        <li>The research is conducted by or under the direction of any employee, or student, or agents of the University in connection with his or her institutional responsibilities; or </li>
        <li>The research is conducted using any property or facility owned or controlled by the University. </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>8.2.4</strong> The Vice President for Research is authorized to review all proposed research, and decide whether the University will permit the research, as appropriate to the role and scope of the University. </p>
    <p><strong>8.2.5</strong> If allegations of animal mistreatment or protocol noncompliance are reported, the IACUC will conduct an investigation in accordance with procedures outlined in the institution’s Assurance of Compliance with Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.  Circumstances that will be reported in writing to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) by the Institutional Official, without delay, are:  serious or continuing noncompliance with the PHS Policy; serious deviations from the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals; and IACUC protocol suspensions. </p>
    <p><strong>8.2.6</strong> Any person responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of animal subject research that has an economic interest in, or acts as an officer or director of any outside entity whose financial interests would reasonably appear to be affected by the research should be removed from the project, due to conflict of interest as provided in Chapter 2, Section IV, of this Handbook.</p>

<h2>8.3 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Procedures</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <p><strong>8.3.1</strong> The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) reviews all proposals involving the use of vertebrate animals.  The IACUC meets monthly, and as needed for proposal review, policy development, and noncompliance investigations. </p>
    <p><strong>8.3.2</strong> Principal Investigators consult with the Attending Veterinarian during proposal development for the use of vertebrate animals and submit a detailed proposal to the IACUC Office in the Office of Research and Sponsored Projects. </p>
    <p><strong>8.3.3</strong> Proposals are made available for review by all members of the IACUC.  Most proposals will initially undergo full-committee review at a convened meeting of a quorum of the IACUC.  Proposals that are classified in United States Department of Agriculture Pain/Distress Categories A-C can be sent to designated review after the proposal has been made available to all members for a minimum of 4 working days. Proposals that are classified as Category D and E procedures are automatically slated for full-committee review, but can be referred to designated review after full-committee review if the proposal requires either modifications to secure approval or has been tabled for clarification.  Changes to proposals (amendments) and annual progress reports must be submitted by the Principal Investigator(s) to the IACUC and are processed in the same manner as described above. </p>
    <p><strong>8.3.4</strong> In addition to determining whether the proposal conforms with the Institution’s Assurance, the IACUC will consider each of the following criteria for review prior to approving the use of vertebrate animals in research: </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The design and performance of procedures are based on relevance to human or animal health, advancement of knowledge, or the good of society; </li>
        <li>The appropriate species and number of animals are to be used; </li>
        <li>The living conditions of the animals are appropriate for the species and the appropriate husbandry will be directed and performed by qualified personnel; </li>
        <li>Procedures are in place to avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals; </li>
        <li>Appropriate sedation, analgesia, or anesthesia are provided as needed unless justification for non-use is described in writing by the investigator; </li>
        <li>Medical care is provided by a qualified veterinarian; </li>
        <li>Research personnel are appropriately qualified and trained to perform any procedures relating to animals; </li>
        <li>Humane endpoints have been established; and </li>
        <li>Methods of euthanasia are consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia.     </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>8.3.5</strong> Notification of IACUC action regarding a proposal will be made in writing to the Principal Investigator(s) and the Vice President for Research. These actions include approval, modifications required to secure approval, withhold approval, or defer or table review.  Proposals are approved for a three year period.  All animal use projects must undergo continuing IACUC review via submission of an annual progress report by the Principal Investigator(s) to the IACUC.</p>
