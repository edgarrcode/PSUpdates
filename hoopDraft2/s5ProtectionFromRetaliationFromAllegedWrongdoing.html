    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>8.4.3.1</strong> Within five (5) working days after receipt of a written retaliation complaint, the Retaliation Complaint Officer will send the complainant a brief acknowledgment of the complaint, stating that the complaint will be evaluated, and advising the complainant that he or she will be contacted within a given time.  The acknowledgment letter will include a copy of these Procedures for the Handling of an Allegation of Retaliation. The Retaliation Complaint Officer also shall keep the complainant apprised of the status of the investigation of the matter, to the extent that the Retaliation Complaint Officer determines that the communication does not compromise the integrity of the investigation.</p>

        <p><strong>8.4.3.2</strong> Also within five (5) working days after receipt of a written retaliation complaint, the Retaliation Complaint Officer shall inform the Department Head/Chair of the allegation.

    <p><strong>8.4.4</strong> Complaint Evaluation</p>

    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>8.4.4.1</strong> The Retaliation Complaint Officer will initiate an investigation if the written, signed complaint contains all of the mandatory information and is timely, within the scope of this Policy, and states sufficient specific facts, which, if determined to be true, would support a finding that the non-retaliation provisions of this Policy were violated.  Notwithstanding that the complaint meets the foregoing requirements, the Retaliation Complaint Officer may determine not to proceed with a complaint investigation for any one of the following reasons: </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>the complainant withdraws the complaint; </li>
            <li>corrective action has been taken, or has been offered and rejected;</li>
            <li>another complaint resolution process is more appropriate; or</li>
            <li>litigation or another complaint process is pending. </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>8.4.4.2</strong> If the Retaliation Complaint Officer determines not to proceed with a complaint investigation, he or she will send a notification letter to the complainant stating the reason for that determination.  The notification letter will also include a statement informing the complainant that the complainant may appeal the determination not to proceed.  The appeal must be delivered to the President or his or her designee within ten (10) working days after the complainant’s receipt of the notification letter.  The appeal must be in writing and signed by the complainant and must state why the decision not to proceed with an investigation of the retaliation complaint was in error. </p>

        <p><strong>8.4.4.3</strong> The President or designee will respond within twenty (20) working days of receipt of the appeal.  If the decision to dismiss is upheld, that decision is final.

    </div><!-- Level4 -->

    <h3>8.4.5 Investigative Process and Findings</h3>

    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>8.4.5.1</strong> If it is determined that the institution will proceed with a retaliation complaint investigation, the Retaliation Complaint Officer or his or her designee will interview the complainant, the respondent, and any other persons whom the investigator determines may have pertinent factual information related to the retaliation complaint.  The investigator shall also gather and examine relevant documents.  Facts will be considered on the basis of what is reasonable to persons of ordinary sensitivity and not on the basis of a particular sensitivity or reaction of an individual.  Findings will be based on the totality of circumstances surrounding the alleged retaliation.</p>

        <p><strong>8.4.5.2</strong> During the retaliation complaint investigation process, the complainant and the respondent will provide the Retaliation Complaint Officer or designee with all documents relied upon regarding the issues raised in the complaint.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->

    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>8.4.6.1</strong> The investigator will provide a proposed statement of findings, copies of relevant documents, and relevant physical evidence to the President or his or her designee within thirty (30) working days of receipt of the respondent's statement, unless unusual circumstances require more time.  The President or designee and the investigator shall meet within ten (10) working days thereafter to discuss the findings. </p>

        <p><strong>8.4.6.2</strong> Within fifteen (15) working days after that meeting, the President or designee shall take one of the following actions:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Request further investigation into the complaint;</li>
            <li>Dismiss the complaint; or</li>
            <li>Find that the non-retaliation provisions of the University were violated, in which event the President or designee, following consultation with the investigator or other knowledgeable persons as appropriate, shall determine disciplinary or corrective actions to be taken.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>8.4.6.3</strong> The President or designee shall notify in writing the complainant, respondent, and appropriate Department Head/Chair of his or her decision, and shall attach a copy of the final statement of findings to the notification.  The Retaliation Complaint Officer shall retain copies of the President’s letter, the statement of findings, and relevant documents in accordance with the institution’s records retention schedule.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->

    <h3>8.4.7 Substitution of Officers</h3>
