            <div class="mainContent">

<h2>6.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Travel by University employees is governed by the State of Texas Travel Regulations Act, the General Appropriations Act, the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents, official interpretations of the Travel Act, as made by the State Comptroller of Public Accounts, and by the policies of this Handbook.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>6.1.1 Employee's Responsibility</h3>
    <p>All employees are required to be aware of the state laws, and the Rules and Regulations governing travel by state employees. Failure to comply could result in non-reimbursement of travel expenses. Information regarding travel regulations is available from the University Travel coordinator and from the website maintained by that office.</p>
    <p>Stricter guidelines may be imposed by individual departments and, in addition, some sources of funds may impose additional restrictions, (e.g. contract and grant funding).</p>
</div><!-- Level3 -->


<hr>
<h2>6.2 Travel Authorization</h2>
<p>Prior supervisory approval for all business travel is required for absences from the campus (or other designated headquarters) for periods of half a day or more during the normal working period, whether or not there is a cost to The University.</p>
<p>A Request for Travel Authorization must be completed prior to travel, and approval is delegated to the immediate supervisor. Approved requests must be routed through the department chair or director and forwarded to the appropriate Dean or other administrative officer for approval. The form will then be routed to the appropriate Vice President and to the Travel Coordinator for final approval and distribution, except foreign travel and travel to Washington D.C., which require final approval from the President's Office.</p>
<p>The Request for Travel Authorization must state the traveler's name, dates of travel, destination, purpose and benefit of travel, and the account to be charged. Appropriate arrangements for disposition of duties must be made in advance of the travel. Travel requests by faculty members must contain a statement describing the disposition of work and/or classes missed during the period of travel. If classes are to be missed, a qualified member of the instructional staff shall be identified to and approved by the departmental Chair as a substitute instructor. Under normal circumstances, classes should not be rescheduled.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>6.2.1 Student Travel Policy</h3>
    <p>Refer to the Student Affairs section of the Handbook at http://admin.utep.edu/hoop.</p>
    <h3>6.2.2 Prospective State Employees or Prospective Students</h3>
    <p>When a prospective employee is requested to travel for an employment interview, he or she may be reimbursed for travel expenses in the same manner as a state employee. A travel advance may not be issued to a prospective employee. Prospective employees are not exempt from hotel occupancy taxes and may be reimbursed for those taxes. A RTA VE5 is not created for prospective state employees or students.</p>
    <h3>6.2.3 Disabled Officers and Employees</h3>
    <p>A disabled officer or employee who is required to travel on official state business may be reimbursed for attendant care travel expenses. The attendant travel expenses are subject to the same rules as the employee. First class airfare for disabled employees is allowable only if it is medically necessary.</p>
    <h3>6.2.4 Special Travel Regulations for Other than Educational and General Funds</h3>
    <p>Provisions of the preceding general travel regulations apply to all UTEP employees and all funds. However, if applicable, employees may travel under the auspices of contracts, gifts, grants, or designated funds, in which case they may elect to take advantage of the following exceptions:</p>
    <h3>6.2.5 Travel on Sponsored Project (Grant) Funds, Gifts, and Designated Funds</h3>
    <p>Travel allowances under other grants or contracts will be in accordance with the terms of the contract. However, if the contract does not specify terms for travel, then the general travel regulations will apply. For travel from, or derived from, federal or state agencies, travel allowances will be those specified in the general travel regulations.</p>
    <p>For all gifts, designated funds, and grants, travel allowances will be for expenses involving meals, lodging and airport parking fees, not to exceed rates specified in the general travel regulations per day. This applies for both in-state and out-of-state travel. Lodging receipts must be submitted for reimbursement of claims. The transportation allowances will follow the provisions of the general travel regulations.</p>
    <p>The provisions above are subject to the terms and conditions of the particular gift or grant involved, which may supersede the above provisions. When not prohibited by the terms of the contract or grant, employees may be reimbursed for required registration fees or similar expenses incurred while attending meetings of organizations or associations. Receipts for such expenses must be secured and attached to the document if reimbursement is expected.</p>
    <p>An employee may be reimbursed for travel expenses from both a non-state agency source and from the State of Texas so long as the total reimbursement from all sources is not greater than actual expenses.</p>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <h4>6.2.5.1 Contracts & Grants:</h4>
        In addition to institutional approval, special written approval from the granting agency may be required if specific authorization is not provided for under the terms of the contract or grant. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to secure all necessary approvals; failure to do so will result in disallowance of the travel expenses.
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    <h3>6.2.6 Dues and Registration Fees</h3>
    <p>Registration Fees - Reimbursement for registration fees, or similar expenses incurred when attending any type of organization or association meeting, will be made only if the associated membership is directly related to the duties performed by the employee and the type of conference attended. Receipt showing who paid and the form of payment must be submitted.</p>
    <p>Meals and lodging may not be claimed in the registration fee except when the meals are included as a non-optional, incidental expense of the fee.</p>
    <p>Entertainment or other personal items may not be claimed.</p>
    <p>A registration fee can be paid in advance by a state agency, but only if the fee is paid in the same fiscal year as the date of the conference.</p>
    <p>EXCEPTION: A registration fee that includes a membership fee may be paid in advance and charged to the current year's appropriation, if the request is made no earlier than six (6) weeks prior to the date of the conference. Every effort should be made to attend "paid in advance" conferences and, with the approval of the supervisor, one employee may replace another employee at the conference.</p>
    <h3>6.2.7 Membership Fees and Dues</h3>
    <p>Memberships in professional organizations must be in the name of the University, not an individual employee, and require written approval from the President or the President's designee prior to payment. Reimbursement for membership fees and dues in professional organizations will be made if there is a direct relationship between the duties performed by the employee and the organization. Receipts are required, with a justification statement explaining the necessity of paying the membership fee.</p>
    <h3>6.2.8 Packaged Travel Arrangements (Tour Packages)</h3>
    <p>If meal or lodging expenses are mandatory and included with the registration fee, then they are fully reimbursable. If meal and lodging expenses are not mandatory, then the reimbursement may not exceed the meal and lodging limits.</p>
</div><!-- Level3 -->


<hr>
<h2>6.3 Meals and Lodging</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>6.3.1 General Rules - In-State Travel</h3>
    <p>Only single occupancy rates can be claimed. If two or more employees share lodging, the expense should be divided equally between the employees, and documented on both reimbursement forms. Excess meal and lodging expenses for one day may not be carried forward or backward to another day. Expenses incurred the day before official business begins or the day after official business ends are reimbursable. Expenses incurred more than one day before official business begins or more than one day after official business ends are reimbursable only if the expenses are incurred to qualify for a discount airfare and results in a savings to the University. Meal and lodging expenses are not reimbursable without an overnight stay.</p>
    <p>Expense reimbursement for in-state travel is limited to State of Texas per diem rates.</p>
    <p>Employees of The University of Texas are exempt from Texas state hotel occupancy taxes. A traveler must present the hotel with a completed exemption certificate. If a hotel refuses to honor the certificate, the traveler will be reimbursed for the tax, and the state comptroller should be notified of the hotel's refusal. University employees are not exempt from county or municipal hotel occupancy taxes, and these taxes are reimbursable.</p>
    <p>When traveling out of state, the meal expense reimbursement rate may be reduced and a corresponding amount used to increase the lodging reimbursement rate. However, lodging expense may not be reduced to increase the meal reimbursement rate.</p>
    <p>LODGING RECEIPTS ARE REQUIRED. Employees may not claim lodging for more than actual costs including room taxes. Meal receipts are required if in excess of $30 per day.</p>
    <p>Employers are required to report per diem payments not involving an overnight stay as Other Compensation on the employee's W-2 form.</p>
    <p>Travel Status for a Continuous Period of Less than Six (6) Hours: Only transportation expenses will be paid to an employee who is away from designated headquarters for a period of less than six (6) hours.</p>
    <p>The above provisions are applied strictly when the cost of travel is to be paid from State Appropriated Funds. For special exceptions, see Special Travel for General Travel Rules and Regulations of the State of Texas Travel Allowance Guide at web site:</p>
    <p>http://www.window.state.tx.us/comptrol/san/fm_manuals/tag_man/02tag_man/pdftravelallowtoc.html</p>
    <h3>6.3.2 Out-of-State Lodging Rates</h3>
    Rate schedules, which are effective September 1st of each year, may be accessed at Web site address:
    http://www.window.state.tx.us/comptrol/san/fm.notices.date.html/fm02/oosmealsandlodgingrates02.pdf
    <h3>6.3.3 General Rules for Out-of-State Travel Reimbursement</h3>
    <p>The meals and lodging schedule is to be used for out-of-state travel within the Continental United States by state employees. The rates may be found in *DEFINE using the GG1 command. Employees, who travel to Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, Guam or any U.S. possession, may be reimbursed for their actual meals and lodging expenses, provided prior written approval is obtained from the President's Office. If this approval is not received, the rates for meals and for lodging on the website apply, but not to exceed $350 per day. (Website address listed at the beginning of the Travel Guidelines.)</p>
    <p>State accounts and state-funded 18 and 26 accounts are limited by the federal travel regulations. The rates may be found in *DEFINE using the GG1 command. Locality limits are based on key cities within a state. When traveling to a city not listed, the limit is based on the county in which the city is located. If neither the city nor the county is listed, the reimbursement is limited to the median rate.</p>
    <p>Local accounts are limited to a combination of actual meal and lodging expenses, not to exceed $250 per day. If meal expenses exceed $35 per day, receipts together with an explanation will be required.</p>
    <p>If the city traveled to is not listed on the meals and lodging schedule, the employee may contact the Travel Coordinator, who will assist in having the city added. The state schedule can be found at:</p>
    <p>http://www.window.state.tx.us/comptrol/san/fm.notices.date.html/fm02/fm02-16_intro.html.</p>
    <p>Employees should always list the city and county traveled within on their travel voucher. This will help expedite the processing of the voucher. All travel is based on the actual meals and lodging expenses incurred by an employee, not to exceed the rates set out in the schedule.</p>
    <p>LODGING RECEIPTS ARE REQUIRED. Employees may not claim lodging that is more than actual costs including room taxes. Meal receipts are required if in excess of allowed per diem for that locality. Partial meal allowances for the day of return from out-of-state travel are based on the locality meal rate and appropriate percentage rate as shown below:</p>
    <p>Local accounts are limited to a combination of actual meal and lodging expenses, not to exceed $250 per day. If meal expenses exceed $35 per day, receipts together with an explanation will be required.</p>
    <h3>6.3.4 Other Reimbursement Guidelines</h3>
    <p>An employee may not be reimbursed for meals or lodging expenses incurred within the employee's designated headquarters. An employee may be reimbursed if the expenses are mandatory and connected with training, a seminar, or a conference.</p>
    <p>Meal and lodging expenses may not be reimbursed for any days the employee is absent from duty for personal reasons. Personal reasons include, but are not limited to, illness, a family emergency, breakdown of a motor vehicle, and any occurrence not connected with official duties.</p>
    <p>An employee can only be reimbursed for his or her own expenditures. Employees are not allowed reimbursement for expenditures incurred by other individuals. Alcoholic beverages and tips/gratuities are not reimbursable expenses.</p>
    <p>Local Accounts may reimburse tips and gratuities incurred during travel for official business. The amount of the reimbursement may not exceed 15%. The tip or gratuity is separate from the daily meal limit and should be itemized in the comments section of the VP2 voucher.</p>
    <h3>6.3.5 Hotel Occupancy Taxes</h3>
    <p>A University employee may be reimbursed for travel outside the State of Texas for the required payment of hotel occupancy or similar taxes. The reimbursement is classified as an incidental expense. The taxes are not classified as a lodging expense for the purpose of the maximum reimbursement rate for those expenses.</p>
    <h3>6.3.6 Maximum Reimbursement</h3>
    <p>This section applies only when a University employee is entitled to reimbursement for his payment of hotel occupancy or similar tax. If the tax is calculated as a percentage of the lodging rate, the reimbursement may not exceed the percentage multiplied by the maximum that may be reimbursed to the employee for his lodging expenses at the location.</p>
    <h3>6.3.7 Lease of an Apartment Or House</h3>
    <p>If a department anticipates that an employee will be at a duty point for at least one month, the expense of leasing an apartment or house may be reimbursed. The apartment or house must be leased from a commercial establishment. The name of the employee must appear in the lease, and the purpose for leasing must be the conservation of state funds. Any deposit required for the lease of a house or apartment is the sole responsibility of the employee and is not reimbursable.</p>

<hr>
<h2>6.4 Transportation</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>    6.4.1 Travel by Rented or Public Conveyance/Commercial Air</h3>
    <p>The reimbursement for commercial air transportation may not exceed the cost of the lowest available airfare. First class airfare may be reimbursed if it was the only available airfare.</p>
    <p>When an employee combines business and personal air travel, his or her reimbursement may not exceed the amount airfare would have been had he or she not included personal travel. So long as that limit is not exceeded, he or she may be reimbursed for all airfare. Federal taxes on airfare are reimbursable.</p>
    <h3>6.4.2 Travel by Mass Transit, Taxi, or Limousine</h3>
    <p>Receipts are not required when traveling within a city by public transportation. However, if public transportation is used for travel between cities, receipts are required. The cost of limousine transportation may be reimbursed only if it is the lowest transportation available.</p>
    <h3>6.4.3 Rented Vehicle Required Use</h3>
    <p>University employees are required to use the rental companies under state contract with the General Services Commission.</p>
    <p>The names of currently contracted rental car agencies are available from the University Travel Coordinator.</p>
    <h3>6.4.4 Rental Vehicles and Rental Insurance/ Rental Vehicles </h3>
    <p>Free Loss/Damage Waiver (LDW) and free primary liability coverage is provided by state contracted Rental Car Agencies. If additional insurance is desired, it must be provided at the employee's expense.</p>
    <p>The University of Texas System provides supplemental insurance coverage for University employees conducting University business by rental vehicle. The insurance coverage is, however, secondary to any personal insurance held by the employee or that provided under a rental or lease agreement.</p>
    <p>Personal automobile insurance policies will provide excess coverage to long-term leased vehicles and short-term rental vehicles in most cases. Individuals may wish to verify this fact with their personal insurance agent. Collision and comprehensive protection is provided for rental vehicles that are secured through an agency that does not provide such coverage by contract with The University of Texas, or the traveler has inadvertently not selected the insurance coverage offered by the rental car agency.</p>
    <p>If an employee should have an accident while in a rental vehicle, regardless of fault, he or she should notify the Assistant to the Vice President for Business Affairs.</p>
    <h3>6.4.5 Taxes and Fees</h3>
    <p>If an employee pays for a car rental with any type of individual charge card, he or she will be reimbursed for the cost of the rental including the tax.</p>
    <h3>6.4.6 Refueling Provisions</h3>
    <p>Vehicles are provided to travelers with a full tank of gas. Fuel is not included in the rate. If a vehicle is returned with less than a full tank of gas, refueling fees will vary based on the vendor and location. Refueling fees are generally higher than "gas pump" prices and can be as much as 50% above local market price. It is strongly recommended that a prepaid fuel option be chosen at the time of the rental or that the vehicle be returned with a full tank of gas.</p>
    <p>When an employee uses a rental vehicle for both personal business and state business, only the portion attributable to state business may be reimbursed. Rental expenses may not be reimbursed if the rental was necessary only because the employee combined personal and state business.</p>
    <p>If two or more employees share a rented vehicle, only the employee who paid the cost of renting the vehicle may be reimbursed. The other employees may not be reimbursed for any costs associated with renting the vehicle.</p>
    <p>Charges for liability insurance supplements, personal accident insurance, safe trip insurance and personal effects insurance are not reimbursable. The charge for an additional driver is reimbursable only if it is for another state employee. A collision damage waiver or a loss damage waiver is reimbursable unless the waiver is included in the contracted rental rate.</p>
    <h3>6.4.7 Use of Personal Car on Official University Business</h3>
    <p>Reimbursement will be limited to the University rate for mileage. A mileage log must be maintained as support for the reimbursement.</p>
    <h3>6.4.8 Personal Car Mileage</h3>
    <p>Mileage is determined by "The Official State Mileage Guide.," published by the Office of the State. The distance listed in the mileage guide is the maximum number of miles for which an employee may be reimbursed. However, the distance between two locations as listed in the mileage guide is not the maximum if one or both locations is not listed by the mileage guide as a measuring point, and the mileage claimed is itemized on a point-to-point basis. The current mileage reimbursement rate can be obtained by calling the Accounts Payable Office at 747-5163.</p>
    <h3>6.4.9 Personal Travel</h3>
    <p>Personal travel does not require notice, and personal activities and personal activities interspersed with official business travel should be identified on the Travel Request as such, but no itinerary is needed.</p>
    <h3>6.4.10 Weekend Travel</h3>
    <p>If official state business temporarily ends on Friday and resumes on Monday, the employee may have the option to stay at the duty point or return to headquarters for the weekend. If the employee chooses to remain at the duty point, expenses for the weekend are subject to the same limitations as weekday travel. If the employee decides to return to headquarters, the travel reimbursement shall be limited to the lesser of the expenses that would have been reimbursed, had the employee stayed at the duty point, and the transportation expenses incurred returning to headquarters and going back to the duty point.</p>
    <p>Reimbursable expenses are limited if an employee leaves a duty point and travels for personal reasons to a location other than headquarters for the weekend. Weekend travel expenses may not exceed the average weekday travel cost multiplied by the number of days in the weekend.</p>
    <h3>6.4.11 Travel While On Personal Leave</h3>
    <p>If an employee on personal leave at a location outside the designated headquarters is required to travel to a duty point, the travel expenses incurred may be reimbursed. The reimbursement shall not exceed the lesser of the amount of actual travel expenses and the amount that would have been incurred had the employee traveled from his or her headquarters.</p>
    <p>When an employee is required to return to headquarters while on personal leave, he or she may be reimbursed for the travel expenses incurred while traveling to headquarters and returning to the place he or she was staying while on personal leave.</p>

    <li>Uses an airline ticket source required as part of an organized conference, meeting, workshop, course, or seminar. The reason(s) for not using a University contract travel agency must be indicated on the travel authorization document and travel reimbursement document.</li>
</ol>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>6.5.1 Travel Agency Contracts</h3>
    <p>UTEP has contracted a local travel agency to provide travel services for University travelers. The University agreement with this agency includes guaranteed lowest airfare at time of booking.</p>
    <p>A service fee will be assessed by the travel agency for each airline ticket issued, refunded, or exchanged. This service fee applies to all travelers regardless of the purpose of the trip (business, combination of business and personal, or only personal). No service fees will be charged by the travel agency for: (a) hotel and car reservations, even if unaccompanied by an airline ticket, (b) voided transactions (for voided transactions there will not be a charge for the issued ticket or the subsequent void), (c) cancellations (d) consolidator-fare tickets and (e) name changes for group athletic travel. Third party charges, such as those charges associated with express mailing and visa processing, are the responsibility of the requesting employee or individual traveler.</p>
    <h3>6.5.2 Contracted Airfares</h3>
    <p>The General Services Commission contracts with multiple airlines to provide state contracted airfares. University employees are required to use the state-contracted airfares when University funds are used for the travel costs. First class airfare may be reimbursed if it was the only available airfare.</p>
    <p>State contracted airfares are available to employees for business-related travel or to prospective employees where travel is being paid by the state. They are not to be used for leisure, personal or non-state business travel, nor are they available to independent contractors/consultants engaged by the University.</p>
    <h3>6.5.3 Constructive Airfare</h3>
    <p>Constructive airfare is the cost comparison between airfare expenses and reimbursement for personal car mileage. <u>If a personal car is used, the lesser of the airfare or mileage rate is reimbursed</u>. It must be documented that constructive airfare is being used, and an itinerary from the travel agency showing the cost of airfare must be provided. Of course, if mileage incurred is less than the distance listed in the Guide, then a reimbursement for the mileage is limited to the actual mileage incurred.</p>
    <p>Coordination of travel must occur when two to four employees, employed by the same department, travel from the same headquarters to the same duty point at the same time.</p>
    <p>When coordination of travel is required, only one of the employees may be reimbursed for mileage. However, mileage incurred to travel to a pick up point by other employees may be reimbursed. Coordination of travel is not required if it is determined infeasible for business reasons.</p>
    <p>With the exception of tolls and parking expenses, reimbursement of mileage is inclusive of all expenses associated with the operation of a personally owned or leased vehicle.</p>
    <p>An employee may be reimbursed mileage for travel between his or her home and the nearest airport. If travel occurs during work hours, reimbursement may not exceed the reimbursement that would be received had the employee traveled from headquarters to the airport. The scheduled departure and arrival times of the employee's flight determine whether the travel to the airport was during work hours. UTEP has standardized and maintains a maximum twenty (20) mile reimbursement for mileage to and from the airport at a rate of .35 cents per mile, totaling $7.00.</p>
    <p>An employee may be reimbursed for the mileage incurred by another person transporting the employee to the airport. The mileage reimbursement may not exceed the reimbursement that would have been paid if the employee had parked at the airport.</p>
    <h3>6.5.4 Expenses Incurred While Qualifying For Discount Airfare (Free or Discounted Travel)</h3>
    <p>When an employee stays extra days at a duty point to qualify for a discount airfare, he or she may be reimbursed for the travel expenses incurred if the additional expenses plus the discount airfare are less than or equal to the average coach airfare. It must be in the best interest of the University to allow the employee to be absent for the extra days. The extra days may occur before or after the official state business.</p>
    <h3>6.5.5 Charging Air Travel - Corporate Card Central Billing Account (CBA)</h3>
    <p>The Central Billing Account (CBA) is a central billing account designed for the charging of business airfare only and only through the contracted travel agency. Use of the CBA eliminates the need to use a traveler's personal credit card or a travel advance to pay for airfare.</p>
    <p>The following procedure must be followed every time the CBA is used:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The department will contact the designated agencies to make airline reservations for the approved travel, advising the travel agency that a CBA will be used. The agency will accept the employee's reservations and provide him or her pricing, but cannot issue the ticket until they receive a CBA authorization from the responsible departmental office.</li>
        <li>The airline tickets and, in some cases, boarding passes will be delivered by the designated agency per the employee's instructions.</li>
        <li>When completing the Travel Reimbursement form, the cost of the airline ticket must be listed and stated as paid by a CBA; the cost of the airline ticket should not be included for reimbursement to the traveler. Any questions regarding the use of the CBA or to request a CBA account are to be addressed to the UTEP Travel Coordinator. NOTE: ALL AIR TRAVEL CHARGES MUST BE PAID WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS OR THE UNIVERSITY WILL BE SUBJECT TO INTEREST PENALTIES AS PRESCRIBED IN THE TEXAS PROMPT PAYMENT ACT.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>6.5.6 Corporate Cards </h3>
    <p>Corporate charge cards are available to UTEP employees who travel on official University business at least five (5) trips per year or spend at least $1,500 per fiscal year on official University business. The card is available through the University Travel Coordinator at no charge (the annual fee is waived), but is to be used for official business expenditures only.</p>
    <p>When obtaining a charge card, the employee accepts the responsibility for paying all charges in a timely manner and agrees that the charge card is intended for University business use only.</p>
    <p>A corporate travel charge card issued to an employee of the University of Texas at El Paso by the State of Texas remains the property of the State of Texas and should be used only for official University business travel charges. Use of the corporate travel charge card by an employee for personal business is considered a violation of and University regulations and will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>
    <p>The card is issued in the employee's name and the employee is the sole guarantor of payment. The University is not liable for payment of any charges on these cards. The University of Texas at El Paso receives monthly reports of charges made on all charge cards and the status of payments. Charges and payments are reviewed for compliance with guidelines stipulated on the Card Use Agreement signed by the employee at the time of application. Delinquent accounts may be assessed delinquent fees and the accounts may be closed.</p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the University's Vice President for Business Affairs and the University's Travel Coordinator to monitor charges and payment status on all individual corporate charge cards issued to its employees, and to ensure compliance with the regulations and penalties stipulated on the Card Use Agreement.</p>
    <h3>6.5.7 Air Travel Insurance</h3>
    <p>Reservations made through the travel agency currently servicing UTEP include automatic flight insurance in the amount of $100,000 to the traveler at no additional cost to the University or individual. When an employee's airline ticket is charged to a CBA, through the contract travel agency on either the corporate card or personal card, he or she is provided with $200,000 travel insurance in addition to the insurance provided by the travel agency.</p>
    <h3>6.5.8 Cancellation or Change Charges</h3>
    <p>Charges for cancellation or change of travel ticketing is reimbursable only if the charge is incurred for a business-related reason or because of adverse weather conditions or a natural disaster. Charges incurred for personal reasons, such as illness, family emergency, or Non State-contracted airfare cancellations and changes cannot be reimbursed.</p>
    <h3>6.5.9 Lost or Stolen Tickets</h3>
    <p>An employee may be reimbursed for a lost or stolen ticket if he or she exercised reasonable care to safeguard the ticket.</p>
    <h3>6.5.10 Death of an Employee</h3>
    <p>The University may reimburse the cost of transporting an employee's body back to El Paso if the employee dies while on approved travel. The amount paid may not exceed the amount that would have been reimbursed had the employee not died. The payment must be made to the deceased employee or his/her estate and may not be paid directly to the company transporting the body.</p>
    <p>The state will pay for return of the remains and any costs involved in the unused ticket.</p>

<h2>6.6 Washington D.C Travel</h2>
<p>State law requires state agencies with personnel traveling to Washington D.C., to notify the Office of State-Federal Relations in advance of such travel. The UTEP Travel Coordinator, upon receipt of travel requests for Washington D.C., processes such notifications. The report requires a day-by-day breakdown of the itinerary of the traveler, to include, names of persons, agencies, organizations, and other entities to be visited. Such information must be included on the Travel Request or accepted when forwarded for approval. Acronyms or abbreviations for the names of conferences, agencies or organizations, are not to be used, as they may not be understood by reviewing parties. The guidelines outlined below clarify travel purposes that are subject to the notification requirement.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>6.6.1 Travel Requiring Notice</h3>
    <p>All travel to Washington D.C. that is paid for, or reimbursed from, state funds requires notice. This includes:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Travel for professional meetings or training, not involving visits to federal agencies or Congress</li>
        <li>Travel where expenses are reimbursed by non-state agencies (e.g. NIH, NSF)</li>
        <li>Travel reimbursed from existing grants or contracts with a federal agency pursuant to the terms of such grants or contracts</li>
        <li>Travel for the purposes of visiting with members of Congress, congressional staff, or federal agencies (other than in connection with an existing contract as described above) that is processed through the state comptroller or institutional accounts (e.g. gift funds, federal funds, practice plan funds).</li>
    </ol>

<h2>6.7 Foreign Travel</h2>
<p>The President must approve all foreign travel in advance. Foreign travel is defined as all countries outside the 50 states, Mexico, Canada and U.S. possessions.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>6.7.1 State Accounts Only:</h3>
    <p>A request for foreign travel approval should be submitted for approval 30 days in advance, but not less than 10 days in advance of departure.</p>
    <p>The U. S. Department of State may issue travel advisories warning against or restricting travel by to specific nations. Should a person request approval to travel to a nation under a travel advisory, the person must include with the Travel Request a signed statement indicating that he or she is aware of the travel advisory and potential risks associated with travel to the nation under the advisory.</p>
    <h3>6.7.2 Foreign Travel Reimbursement</h3>
    <p>When properly approved, the University may reimburse an employee for actual meals and lodging expenses when traveling to foreign countries. All travel expenses must be converted to U.S. dollars and each exchange rate used for the conversion specified on the voucher. Appropriate lodging and meal receipts must be attached to the reimbursement vouchers. Expenses eligible for authorized travel reimbursement to foreign countries other than Canada, Mexico and U.S. possessions are:</p>
    <p>Lodging and meal expenses, reimbursable for the actual amount incurred. Receipts are required for all reimbursable expenses for a total amount not to exceed $350.00 per day. If meal expenses exceed $35 per day, a written explanation is required, and all receipts are required for foreign travel.</p>
    <h3>6.7.3 Foreign Per Diem Rates</h3>
    <p>The State of Texas foreign per diem rates can be found at: http://perdiem.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem/perdiemrates.html and are to be used as a guideline only for estimating the costs for foreign travel and not for reimbursement purposes. Employee travelers are allowed a maximum total expense of $350 per day, and travelers are required to retain all receipts.</p>
    <p>Employees, who travel to Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, Mexico, Guam, Puerto Rico or any U.S. possession, may also be reimbursed for actual expenses for meals and lodging, if prior written approval is received from the President or President's designee. The Request for Travel Authorization must state, "Authorization for actual expenses is requested." Lodging and meal receipts are required.</p>
    <p>If an Internet fare is secured, it is important to note that most are nonrefundable, cannot be changed once booked, and the routing may change from the time of initial inquiry to final purchase. In addition, customer support services may not be available, and travel agencies cannot intercede on behalf of the traveler. While Internet bookings can result in savings, it is important to be aware of restrictions and to be able to comply with them. It is important to note that if a reservation is not made through a designated travel agency, any restrictions or penalties become the responsibility of the traveler.</p>
