                <li>bringing intoxicants or drugs onto the premises of the institution, using intoxicants or drugs on the premises at any time, having intoxicants or drugs in one's possession, or being under the influence of intoxicants or drugs on the premises at any time;</li>

    <h3>6.3.3 Discipline Procedures.</h3>
    <p>The following procedures will be followed when an employee who is subject to this policy is demoted for disciplinary reasons, suspended without pay, or dismissed.</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>The supervisor will review the evidence and the proposed disciplinary action with the chief human resources officer or his or her designee.</li>
        <li>Once the supervisor has sought and obtained the concurrence of the chief human resources officer or his or her designee, he or she must then obtain the concurrence of the department head or administrative equivalent to whom he or she reports before proceeding with the proposed disciplinary action.</li>
        <li>The supervisor shall inform the employee in writing of the reasons for the proposed disciplinary action and the facts upon which the supervisor relies.  The employee shall be provided with an opportunity to respond to the charges either verbally or in writing within a reasonable time not to exceed two (2) working days and to persuade the supervisor that the grounds for the disciplinary action are mistaken or incorrect before a final decision is made to take disciplinary action.  This pre-disciplinary notification serves as an opportunity to avoid mistaken decisions to impose discipline and is not intended to definitively resolve the propriety of the disciplinary action being considered.</li>
        <li>If the supervisor is not persuaded by the employee's response that the decision to take disciplinary action is incorrect or mistaken, the supervisor will proceed to impose the disciplinary action.  The supervisor shall inform the employee in writing of the following:
            <ol>

                <li>whether the disciplinary action is a demotion, suspension without pay or dismissal and its effective date;</li>
                <li>a specific period for a suspension without pay, not to exceed one (1) month, to be determined in consultation with and approval of the Office of Human Resource Services;</li>
                <li>the specific incident, conduct, course of conduct, unsatisfactory work performance or other basis for the disciplinary action;</li>
                <li>any previous efforts to make the employee aware of the need to change or improve work performance or conduct; and</li>
                <li>reference to any relevant rule, regulation or policy.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>6.3.4 Effect Upon Employee Benefits </h3>
    An employee who is demoted or suspended without pay continues to accrue vacation and sick leave, to be covered by group insurance, and to be entitled to other employee benefit programs.  If a demotion or suspension without pay is appealed and the appeal of the demotion or suspension is successful, the employee shall be entitled to payment for wages lost as a result of the demotion or suspension.  If an appeal of dismissal is successful, the employee shall be reinstated to the same or similar position and shall be entitled to payment of back wages less any unemployment compensation insurance benefits received by the employee after the date of dismissal.
    Employee benefits such as vacation and sick leave shall be credited back to the date of dismissal.
