In the case of repeated violations of these solicitations rules, the Dean may cancel the registered status of the offending organization or impose other appropriate penalties.

        <p>After completing his/her preliminary investigation, the Dean may either dismiss the allegation as lacking merit or summon the authorized representative(s) of the organization for a conference. After conferring with the representative(s), the Dean may:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>dismiss the allegation;</li>
            <li>proceed administratively under 4.8.5; or</li>
