                    <h3>1.2.4   Health or Safety</h3>
                    <p>Any student who engages in conduct that endangers the health or safety of any person may be subject to discipline.</p>

Hazing in State educational institutions is prohibited by State law (Texas Education Code Section 51.936 and Sections 37.151-37.157). Hazing with or without the consent of a student whether on or off campus is prohibited, and a violation of that prohibition renders both the person inflicting the hazing and the person submitting to the hazing subject to discipline. Knowingly failing to report hazing can subject one to discipline. Initiations or activities of organizations may include no feature that is dangerous, harmful, or degrading to the student, and a violation of this prohibition renders both the organization and participating individuals subject to discipline.</p>

                    <h3>1.2.11  Altering of Official Documents</h3>
                    <p>A student who alters or assists in the altering or forging of any official record of the U.T.

                    <h3>1.2.15  Sale or Use of Alcoholic Beverages</h3>
                    <p>The University enforces all state and federal laws or regulations which regulate and control the sale or use of alcohol on campus, including those pertaining to the possession of alcohol by minors. University regulations prohibit the possession and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on University property without prior written authorization by appropriate administrative officials and are strictly enforced. Customers of legal age under state law may purchase and consume alcoholic beverages in areas on the campus specifically designated for the public sale and consumption of beer and wine, and residents of University Housing are authorized to possess and consume beer and wine in the privacy of their living quarters, if they are of legal age under state law. Students in violation of these policies will be subject to University discipline in addition to possible criminal prosecution by civil authorities.</p>

                    <h3>1.2.16  Prohibited Conduct During Suspension</h3>
                    <p>A student who receives a period of suspension as a disciplinary sanction is subject to further disciplinary action for prohibited conduct that takes place during the period of suspension.</p>
                </div><!-- Level 3 -->
                <hr>
                <h2>1.3 Bar from Campus</h2>
                <p>A former student who has been suspended or expelled for disciplinary reasons is prohibited from being on the campus of any U.T. System institution during the period of such suspension or expulsion without prior written approval of the chief student affairs officer of the U.T. System institution at which the suspended or expelled student wishes to be present. In a request for such approval, the former student is required to disclose in writing each institution from which the individual has been suspended or expelled and the conduct leading to the disciplinary action.</p>
                
                <hr>
                <h2>1.4 Disciplinary Process  </h2>
                <p>The Dean will conduct an investigation, determine whether to proceed with the charges, and if so, propose the appropriate sanction. Students will have the opportunity to appeal disciplinary action.</p>

                <div class="subSection Level3">
                    <h3>1.4.1 Investigation </h3>
                    <p>Allegations of misconduct will be investigated by the Dean or the Dean’s designee. The Dean may contact a student for a meeting for purposes of the investigation and/or to discuss the allegations. The Dean may also issue a summons for these purposes. A summons shall be in writing, specify a place for the meeting and a time at least three weekdays after the date of the written request if the request is sent regular mail, or at least two weekdays after the date of the request if the request is sent by email or hand delivered. The written request may be mailed to the address appearing in the records of the registrar, emailed to the student at the e-mail address on record with the University, or may be hand delivered to the student. If a student fails to appear without good cause, as determined by the Dean, the Dean may bar or cancel the student’s enrollment or otherwise alter the status of the student until the student complies with the summons. If the student failing to appear as directed in a summons is the student against whom charges are being reviewed, in addition to the above, the Dean may proceed with disciplinary action based upon other information available using the disciplinary procedures below. The refusal of a student to accept delivery of the notice, the failure to maintain a current address with the registrar, or failure to read mail or e-mail shall not be good cause for the failure to respond to a summons.</p>

                    <h3>1.4.2 Reviewing the Evidence and Determining the Sanction</h3>
                    <p>The Dean will review the evidence, determine whether to proceed with charges, and, if so, determine the sanction appropriate to the charges. Before proceeding with disciplinary action, the Dean will offer the student the opportunity to meet to provide a response to the charges and, upon request, to review the available evidence supporting the charges. </p>

                    <h3>1.4.3 Interim Disciplinary Action  </h3>
                    <p>Pending a hearing or other disposition of the allegations against a student, the Dean may take such immediate interim disciplinary action as is appropriate to the circumstances when such action is in the best interest of the University. This includes but is not limited to a suspension and bar from the campus when it reasonably appears to the Dean from the circumstances that the continuing presence of the student poses a potential danger to persons or property or a potential threat for disrupting any activity authorized by the University. In the event interim disciplinary action is taken, an expedited hearing will be offered in accordance with Section 1.5 below. </p>

                    <h3>1.4.4 Withholding Transcripts, Grades, Degrees  </h3>
                    <p>The Dean may also withhold the issuance of an official transcript, grade, diploma, certificate, or degree to a student alleged to have violated a rule or regulation of the U.T. System or the University that would reasonably allow the imposition of such sanction. The Dean may take such action pending a hearing, resolution by administrative disposition, and/or exhaustion of appellate rights if the Dean has provided the student an opportunity to provide a preliminary response to the allegations and if in the opinion of the Dean, the best interests of the U.T. System or the University would be served.</p>

                    <h3>1.4.5 Uncontested Cases with Agreed Sanctions</h3>
                    <p>In any case where the accused student elects not to dispute the facts upon which the charges are based and agrees to the sanctions the Dean assesses, the student may execute a written waiver of the hearing procedures and waiver of any appeals under the policy. This administrative disposition shall be final and there shall be no subsequent proceedings regarding the charges.</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>In those cases in which the accused student disputes the facts upon which the charges are based, the charges shall be heard and determined by a fair and impartial Hearing Officer in accordance with Section 1.5 below. However, a student may elect to sign an administrative disposition waiving the right to the hearing under Section 1.5, but reserving the right to appeal only the sanction. Such an appeal regarding the sanction will be to the University President or his/her designee as determined by University procedures in accordance with Section 1.7 below.</li>
                        <li>Burden of Proof. Upon a hearing of the charges, the Dean or other University representative has the burden of going forward with the evidence and has the burden of proving the charges by the greater weight of the credible evidence.</li>
                    </ol>

                <h2>1.5. Hearing Process.</h2>
                <div class="subSection Level3">
                    <h3>1.5.1   Interim Disciplinary Action Accelerated Hearing</h3>
                    <p>When interim disciplinary action has been taken by the Dean under Section 1.4.3 above, the student will be given the opportunity to have a hearing of the charges in accordance with the procedures specified in Section 1.5.5 below within 10 days after the interim disciplinary action was taken; however, at the discretion of the Dean, the 10-day period may be extended for a period not to exceed an additional 10 days. </p>

                    <h3>1.5.2   Notice of Hearing  </h3>
                    <p>Except in those cases where immediate interim disciplinary action has been taken, the accused student shall be given at least 10 days written notice of the date, time, and place for such hearing and the name of the Hearing Officer. The notice shall include a statement of the charge(s) and a summary statement of the evidence supporting such charge(s). The notice shall be delivered in person to the student or mailed to the student at the address appearing in the registrar's records. A notice sent by mail will be considered to have been received on the third day after the date of mailing, excluding any intervening Sunday. The date for a hearing may be postponed by the Hearing Officer for good cause or by agreement of the student and Dean. </p>

                    <h3>1.5.3   Impartiality of the Hearing Officer(s)  </h3>
                    <p>The accused student may challenge the impartiality of a Hearing Officer(s). The challenge must be in writing, state the reasons for the challenge, and be submitted to the Hearing Officer(s) through the Office of the Dean at least three days prior to the hearing. The Hearing Officer(s) shall be the sole judge of whether he or she can serve with fairness and objectivity. In the event a Hearing Officer(s) disqualifies himself or herself, a substitute will be chosen in accordance with procedures of the University. </p>

                    <h3>1.5.4   Duties of Hearing Officer(s)  </h3>
                    <p>The Hearing Officer(s) is responsible for conducting the hearing in an orderly manner and controlling the conduct of the witnesses and participants in the hearing. The Hearing Officer(s) shall rule on all procedural matters and on objections regarding exhibits and testimony of witnesses, may question witnesses, and is entitled to have the advice and assistance of legal counsel from the Office of General Counsel of the U.T. System. The Hearing Officer(s) shall render and send to the Dean and the accused student a written decision that contains findings of fact and a conclusion as to whether the accused student is responsible for the violations as charged. </p>
                     
                    <p>Upon a finding of responsibility the Hearing Officer(s) shall assess a sanction or sanctions specified in Section 1.6 below. When an accused student is found responsible for the illegal use, possession, or sale of a drug or narcotic on campus, the assessment of a minimum sanction provided in Section 1.2.3 above is required.</p>

                    <h3>1.5.5   Procedures </h3>
                    <p>The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with procedures consistent with the following:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Each party shall provide the other party a list of witnesses, a brief summary of the testimony to be given by each, and a copy of documents to be introduced at the hearing at least five days prior to the hearing.</li>
                        <li>Each party shall have the right to appear, present testimony of witnesses and documentary evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and be assisted by an advisor of choice. The advisor may be an attorney. If the accused student’s advisor is an attorney, the Dean’s advisor may be an attorney from the Office of General Counsel of the U.T. System. An advisor may confer with and advise the Dean or accused student, but shall not be permitted to question witnesses, introduce evidence, make objections or present argument to the Hearing Officer(s).  In sexual harassment/sexual assault cases, the alleged victim shall have the right to be present throughout the hearing, to have an advisor present during the hearing, to have irrelevant past sexual history with third parties excluded from the evidence; and to have a closed hearing. </li>
                        <li>The Dean may recommend a sanction to be assessed by the Hearing Officer(s). The recommendation may be based upon past practice of the University for violations of a similar nature, the past disciplinary record of the student, or other factors deemed relevant by the Dean. The accused student shall be entitled to respond to the recommendation of the Dean.</li>
                        <li>The hearing will be recorded.

                <h2>1.7. Appeal Procedures</h2>
                <p>A student may appeal a disciplinary sanction assessed by the Dean in accordance with Section 1.6(a) above. Either the Dean or the student may appeal the decision of the Hearing Officer(s). In sexual harassment/sexual assault cases, the alleged victim may pursue an appeal under the same procedure as the accused student. An appeal shall be in accordance with the following procedures</p>
                <div class="subSection Level3">
                    <h3>1.7.1   Appeal Procedures</h3>
                    <p>The appealing party must submit a written appeal stating the specific reasons for the appeal and any argument to the University President or his/her designee (hereafter “Appeal Official”) with a copy to the other party. The appeal must be stamped as received in the office of the Appeal Official no later than 14 days after the appealing party has been notified of the sanction assessed by the Dean or the decision of the Hearing Officer(s). </p>
                     
                    If the notice of sanction assessed by the Dean or the decision of the Hearing Officer(s) is sent by mail, the date the notice or decision is mailed initiates the 14-day period for the appeal. The non-appealing party and in sexual harassment/sexual assault cases, the alleged victim, may submit a response to the appeal, which must be received by the Appeal Official no later than five days after receipt of the appeal, with a copy to the other party. An appeal of the sanction assessed by the Dean in accordance with Section 1.4.6(a) above will be reviewed solely on the basis of the written argument of the student and the Dean. The appeal of the decision of the Hearing Officer(s) will be reviewed solely on the basis of the record from the hearing. The Dean will submit the record from the hearing to the Appeal Official as soon as it is available to the Dean. At the discretion of the Appeal Official, both parties may present oral argument in an appeal from the decision of the Hearing Officer(s).</p>

                    <h3>1.7.2   Appeal Official’s Authority</h3>
                    <p>The Appeal Official may approve, reject, or modify the decision in question or may require that the original hearing be reopened for the presentation of additional evidence and reconsideration of the decision. It is provided, however, that upon a finding of responsibility in a case involving the illegal use, possession, and/or sale of a drug or narcotic on campus, the sanction may not be reduced below the sanction as prescribed by Section 1.2.3 above.</p>

                    <h3>1.7.3   Communication of Decision</h3>
                    <p>The action of the Appeal Official shall be communicated in writing to the student(s) and the Dean within 30 days after the appeal and related documents have been received. The decision of the Appeal Official is the final appellate review.</p>
