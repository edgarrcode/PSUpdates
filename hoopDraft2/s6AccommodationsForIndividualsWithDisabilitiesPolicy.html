<h2>2.1 Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this policy is to set out the University’s policy concerning accommodations for individuals with disabilities, and to provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging the violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, including complaints regarding a denial of requested accommodations and auxiliary aids or services, and programs that are perceived to be inaccessible.</p>

<hr>
<h2>2.2 Scope</h2>
<p>This policy applies to students, staff, faculty, job applicants, applicants for admissions, and other beneficiaries of the programs, services, and activities of the University.</p>

<hr>
<h2>2.3 Policy </h2>
<p>The University is committed to providing reasonable accommodations and auxiliary services to students, staff, faculty, job applicants, applicants for admissions, and other beneficiaries of University programs, services and activities with documented disabilities in order to provide them with equal opportunities to participate in programs, services, and activities in compliance with sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Reasonable accommodations will be made unless it is determined that doing so would cause undue hardship on the University.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>2.3.1 Definitions</h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.3.1.1</strong> “Individual with a disability” is a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more life activities, has a record of such impairment, or is regarded as having such impairment.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3.1.2</strong> “Qualified individual” with a disability is defined as an individual who possesses the requisite skills, education, experience, knowledge, and other job requirements and who can, with or without reasonable accommodations, perform the essential functions of the job.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3.1.3</strong> “Substantial limitation” is defined as an impairment that prevents the performance of a major life activity that the average person in the general population can perform; or a significant restriction as to the condition, manner, or duration under which an individual can perform a particular major life activity, as compared to the average person in the general population.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3.1.4</strong> “Accommodation” is defined as a reasonable modification or adjustment to the job application process or the work environment that enables a qualified person with a disability to perform the essential functions of that job.</p>
        <p><strong>2.3.1.5</strong> “Undue hardship” shall conform to definitions provided by the Courts, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Texas Commission of Human Rights Act. In determining whether an accommodation would impose an undue hardship, factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, the nature and cost of the accommodation, financial considerations, the impact of the accommodation upon the nature and operation of the department, and how the request affects the health and safety of other employees or students.</p>

<hr>
<h2>2.4 Requests for Accommodations </h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>2.4.1 Applicants for Employment and Employees </h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.4.1.1</strong> Applicants for employment can initiate a request for accommodation by contacting the Human Resource Services Office, or advising, verbally or in writing, the department in which they will be interviewing, or the chair of the search committee of the possible need for accommodation. Any such inquiry shall be immediately forwarded to the ADA Coordinator for review of the request and determination, if applicable, of reasonable accommodation. </p>
        <p><strong>2.4.1.2</strong> Any employee can initiate a request for accommodation by notifying, in writing, his or her immediate supervisor, the director of Human Resource Services, or the ADA Coordinator of the nature of the disability and the accommodation being requested. Any such request shall be forwarded to the ADA Coordinator for review and determination, if applicable, of a reasonable accommodation to be made. </p>
        <p><strong>2.4.1.3</strong> Individuals will be required to submit a recent medical statement as provided by section 2.4.4.2 within 30 days of the request. </p>
        <p><strong>2.4.1.4</strong> The ADA Coordinator will analyze the request and, to determine eligibility for accommodation, confer with the employee, the supervisor or the applicant to ascertain the individual’s requirements for reasonable accommodation and make a determination regarding which accommodations are necessary. If the employee or applicant is unable to demonstrate a disability, or does not request a reasonable accommodation under applicable statute or regulation, the request may be denied.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    <h3>2.4.2 Beneficiaries of Programs, Services, and Activities </h3>
    <p>Beneficiaries of programs, services, and activities can initiate a request for accommodation by contacting the department or organization hosting the event, program, or activity. Routine requests may be handled directly by the department or organization hosting the event. The administrator of the event, service, or activity will notify the ADA Coordinator of non-routine or other requests. Denial of a request may only be done by the ADA Coordinator, after his/her analysis of the reasonableness of the accommodation and/or determination of an undue hardship to the University, and not by the department or organization hosting the event. The ADA Coordinator will analyze the request and, to determine eligibility for the accommodation, confer with the individual to ascertain his/her requirements for reasonable accommodation and make a determination regarding which accommodations are necessary. If the individual is unable to demonstrate a disability, or does not request a reasonable accommodation under applicable statute or regulation, the request may be denied.</p>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.4.2.1</strong> Individuals may be required to submit a medical statement as provided by section 2.4.4.2. within a reasonable period of time prior to the event, service, or activity.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    <p><strong>2.4.3</strong> Students and Applicants for Admission Students and applicants for admission requesting eligibility for accommodation and services can initiate a request for accommodation(s) by contacting the Director of Disabled Student Services.</p>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.4.3.1</strong> Individuals will be required to submit a recent medical statement as provided by section 2.4.4.2 and the guidelines set forth by the Disabled Student Services at www.utep.edu/dsso within the time frame specified by the Disabled Student Services Office.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4.3.2</strong> The Director of Disabled Student Services will decide whether to grant or deny the request for accommodation. If a student is dissatisfied with the determination, he or she may follow the complaint and appeal procedures outlined below.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    <h3>2.4.4 Provisions Applicable to All Individuals Requesting Accommodation </h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.4.4.1</strong> All offices and individuals responsible for reviewing and analyzing the accommodation request will maintain the confidentiality of all medical and ADA information. Records and information obtained on employees as part of the accommodation request will be kept in the Equal Opportunity Office in separate files. Records and information obtained on students as part of the accommodation request will be kept in the Disabled Student Services Office. Such records shall be shared with only those University employees who have a need to know in order to implement the accommodation request, and shall not be released except as required by law.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4.4.2</strong> Medical statements submitted must be signed by an appropriately licensed professional and contain a diagnosis, prognosis, and a description of the specific impairment(s) and the major life functions and activities affected by the impairment. Individuals may be asked to submit additional medical information if the information originally provided is incomplete, unclear, outdated, or inconsistent. If the individual does not provide the required documentation and information within the specified deadline, the request for accommodation may be cancelled for lack of necessary information.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4.4.3</strong> The University may, at University expense, request an independent medical opinion concerning the impairment for which an individual seeks an accommodation. The failure of an individual to cooperate in obtaining such an opinion will result in the cancellation of the request for accommodation.</p>
