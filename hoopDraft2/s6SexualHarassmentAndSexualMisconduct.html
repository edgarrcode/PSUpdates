            <div class="mainContent">


<h2>3.1 Purpose</h2>
<p>This chapter sets forth the University’s policy concerning sexual harassment and sexual misconduct in compliance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1972, and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code.</p>

<hr>
<h2>3.2 Scope </h2>
<p>This policy applies to all University administrators, faculty, staff, students, visitors, and applicants for employment or admission, and beneficiaries of University programs, services, and activities. It applies not only to unwelcome conduct that violates state and federal laws concerning sexual harassment, but also to inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature. It is also applicable regardless of the gender of the complainant or the alleged harasser.</p>

<hr>
<h2>3.3 Policy</h2>
<p>The University condemns sexual harassment of or by its students, staff, and faculty and is committed to the principle that the learning and working environment of its students, employees, and guests should be free from sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination, is illegal, and is actionable under civil and criminal law. Sexual misconduct and sexual harassment are unprofessional behaviors. Such conduct is prohibited as a matter of institutional policy and will be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

<hr>
<h2>3.4 Definitions </h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>3.4.1 Sexual Misconduct </h3>
    <p>Sexual misconduct includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature directed towards another individual and is unprofessional and inappropriate for the workplace or classroom.</p> 
    <h3>3.4.2 Sexual Harassment </h3>
    <p>Sexual harassment includes unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of employment or student status, either explicitly or implicitly;</li>
            <li>submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for evaluation in making personnel or academic decisions affecting that individual; or</li>
            <li>such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s performance as an administrator, faculty member, staff, or student, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>3.4.3 Examples </h3>
    <p>Examples of behavior that could be considered sexual misconduct or sexual harassment include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ol type="a">
        <li>physical contact of a sexual nature, including touching, patting, hugging, or brushing against a person’s body;</li>
        <li>explicit or implicit propositions of offers to engage in sexual activity;</li>
        <li>comments of a sexual nature, including sexually explicit statements, questions, jokes, or anecdotes;</li>
        <li>remarks of a sexual nature about a person’s clothing or body; </li>
        <li>remarks about sexual activity;</li>
        <li>speculation about sexual experience; exposure to sexually-oriented graffiti, pictures, posters, or materials; and/or </li>
        <li>physical interference with or restriction of an individual’s movements.</li>
        </ol>
</div><!-- Level3 -->


<hr>
<h2>3.5 Consensual Relationships </h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <p><strong>3.5.1</strong> Every consenting romantic or sexual relationship between a faculty member and a student, or between supervisor and employee, may potentially evolve into a sexual harassment case with serious implications, either from a subsequent change of attitude by the parties involved or from a contemporary complaint from a disadvantaged third party. Faculty members exercise power over students, as do supervisors over employees, whether in evaluating them, making recommendations for their promotion or future employment, or conferring other benefits. Others may be adversely affected by the relationship in that it places the faculty member or supervisor in a position to favor or advance one student or employee’s interest at the expense of others.</p>
    <p><strong>3.5.2</strong> As provided in the American Association of University Professors policy on consensual relationships, faculty are expected to be aware of their professional responsibilities in their relationships with students and “avoid apparent or actual conflict of interest, favoritism, or bias.” </p>
    <p><strong>3.5.3</strong> It is the policy of the University that the following romantic or sexual relationships are prohibited:</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>between a faculty member and a student who is enrolled in the faculty member’s course or who is otherwise under the supervision of the faculty member, or</li>
        <li>between a supervisor and a person under his or her supervision.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This policy is not intended to discourage the interaction of faculty and students, and supervisors and employees where it is appropriate and ethical; however, it is intended to clarify that romantic or sexual relationships often create situations that lead to sexual harassment, conflicts of interest, favoritism, and low morale. Therefore, such relationships are prohibited and subject to disciplinary action.</p> 
    <p><strong>3.5.4</strong> Complaints concerning consensual relationships by non-participating individuals will be treated as third-party sexual harassment or sexual misconduct complaints.</p>
</div><!-- Level3 -->

<hr>
<h2>3.6 Resolution and Complaint Procedures</h2>
<p>The informal resolution and formal complaint procedures set forth below are internal administrative procedures of the University. This procedure is available to any member of the University community who believes that he or she has been subjected to sexual harassment and/or sexual misconduct Individuals wishing to utilize this procedure should contact the EO Office or when the accused individual is a student, the Dean of Students. As to those forms of discrimination that also violate state or federal law, an aggrieved party may also file a complaint with the appropriate local, state, or federal agency or in a court of appropriate jurisdiction. These informal resolution and formal complaint procedures are supplemental to, and are not intended to displace, other disciplinary procedures set forth in the University’s Handbook nor the Rules and Regulations of the U.T. System Board of Regents.</p>
    
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>3.6.1 Informal Resolution </h3>
    <p>This process may be used as a prelude to filing a formal complaint or as an alternative. It is not necessary that this option be used. Anyone who believes that he or she has been subject to sexual harassment or sexual misconduct may immediately file a formal complaint as described in Chapter 3.6.2 of this section of the Handbook. An individual wishing to utilize the informal resolution process should contact the EO Office or the Dean of Students, as appropriate. </p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Informal Assistance <br>
        The individual is provided assistance in an attempt to resolve possible sexual harassment or sexual misconduct if the individual does not wish to file a formal complaint. Methods of informal resolution may include, but are not limited to: coaching the person on how to directly address the situation that is causing a problem; mediating the dispute with the parties; aiding in the modification of a situation in which the offensive conduct occurred; assisting a department or division with the resolution of a real or perceived problem; or arranging a meeting with the alleged offender that involves a discussion of the requirements of the sexual harassment and misconduct policy. However, if necessary, the University may take more formal action to ensure an environment free of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct.</li>
        <li>Timeframe <br>
        Informal resolutions will be completed within 30 working days from receipt of a request for informal resolution.</li>
        <li>Confidentiality and Documentation <br>
        The University shall document informal resolutions. The Office of the Dean of Students or the Equal Opportunity Office, as appropriate, shall retain such documentation. The University will endeavor to maintain confidentiality to the extent permitted by law. Relevant information will be provided only to those persons who need to know in order to achieve a timely resolution of the complaint. </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>3.6.2 Formal Complaint Reporting Procedure </h3>
    <p>The complaint procedure herein also constitutes the grievance procedure for complaints alleging unlawful sex discrimination, required under Title IX of the education amendments of 1972. As used herein, “complaint” is synonymous with “grievance.”</p>
    <p>The University of Texas at El Paso encourages any person who believes that he or she has been subjected to sexual misconduct or sexual harassment to immediately report the incident to the appropriate supervisor of the accused faculty member or employee, to the EO Office or, when a student is the accused individual, to the Dean of Students. In no case will a complainant be required to report such conduct to the person accused of the misconduct, for example, where the accused is the complainant’s supervisor. The complainant will be advised of the procedures for filing a formal complaint of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct. When a supervisor or the Dean of Students receives a complaint, he or she will immediately notify the EO Office.</p>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>3.6.2.1</strong> Complaints should be filed as soon as possible after the conduct giving rise to the complaint, but not later than 60 calendar days after the event occurred.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.2.2</strong> In order to initiate the investigation process, the complainant should submit:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>a signed, written statement setting out the details of the conduct that is the subject of the complaint, including the complainant’s name, signature, and contact information;</li>
            <li>the name of the person directly responsible for the alleged violation;</li>
            <li>a detailed description of the conduct or event that is the basis of the alleged violation;</li>
            <li>the date(s) and location(s of the occurrence(s);</li>
            <li>the names of any witnesses to the occurrence(s); </li>
            <li>the resolution sought;</li>
            <li>and any documents or information that is relevant to the complaint.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While an investigation may begin on the basis of an oral complaint, the complainant is strongly encouraged to file a written complaint. If the complaint is not in writing, the investigator should prepare a statement of what he or she understands the complaint to be and seek to obtain verification of the complaint from the complainant When the supervisor or the Dean of Students receives a complaint with a written statement, he/she shall immediately notify the EO Office.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    
    <h3>3.6.3 Formal Complaint Investigation Procedure </h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>3.6.3.1</strong> The Dean of Students, and/or the EO Office, as appropriate, is responsible for investigating formal complaints. If the complaint is not in writing, the investigator should prepare a statement of what he or she understands the complaint to be and seek to obtain verification of the complaint from the complainant.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.2</strong> Within five (5) working days after receipt of a complaint, the Dean of Students, and/or the EO Office, as appropriate, will send the complainant a brief acknowledgment of the complaint, stating that the complaint will be evaluated and advising the complainant that he or she will be contacted within ten (10) working days as to whether the complaint is dismissed or an investigation has been authorized. A formal investigation will be initiated if a complaint is complete, timely, within the scope of this policy and articulates sufficient specific facts, which, if determined to be true would support a finding that this policy was violated. A complaint may be dismissed for a variety of reasons, for example: the complaint fails to describe in sufficient detail the conduct that is the basis of the complaint; the facts alleged in the complaint, even if taken as true, do not constitute discrimination on a protected basis; the complaint fails to allege any facts that suggest discrimination; the complainant declines to cooperate in the investigation; or the appropriate resolution or remedy has already been achieved, or has been offered and rejected.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.3</strong> If it is determined that a complaint will not be investigated, the Dean of Students and/or the EO Office, as appropriate, will send the complainant a notification letter explaining the reason and informing the complainant that, within ten (10) working days of the notification, he or she may appeal the decision not to proceed with a complaint investigation to the appropriate Vice President. The written appeal must explain why the decision to dismiss the complaint was in error. The appropriate Vice President will respond within twenty (20) working days of receipt of the appeal. The Vice President’s decision is final. If the decision to dismiss is overturned, the complaint is sent back to the Equal Opportunity Office or the Office of the Dean of Students, as appropriate, for investigation in accordance with the procedures outlined below.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.4</strong> As part of the investigation process, the accused individual shall be provided with a copy of the complaint and allowed ten (10) working days to respond in writing, unless unusual circumstances warrant additional time. </p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.5</strong> The complainant and the accused individual may present any document or information that is believed to be relevant to the complaint.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.6</strong> Any persons thought to have information relevant to the complaint shall be interviewed, and such interviews shall be appropriately documented. Other acceptable methods for gathering information include, but are not limited to, visual inspection of materials alleged to be offensive, and follow-up interviews as necessary.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.7</strong> The investigation of a complaint will be concluded as soon as possible after receipt of the written complaint. In investigations exceeding 60 working days, a justification for the delay shall be presented to and reviewed by the vice president overseeing the investigative office. The complainant, accused individual, and supervisor will be provided an update on the progress of the investigation after the review.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.8</strong> Upon completion of the investigation, a written report will be issued. The report shall include a recommendation of whether a violation of the policy occurred, an analysis of the facts discovered during the investigation, and recommended disciplinary action, if a violation of the policy occurred. </p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.9</strong> The investigator will provide a copy of the report and copies of relevant documents or other evidence considered to the appropriate vice president or to the vice president’s designee. The investigator will provide a copy of the report to the complainant and respondent, who will have seven (7) working days from the date of the report to submit comments regarding the report to the vice president or his/her designee. However, if a complaint is filed against a student, then the complainant may not receive or comment on the report in accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act’s restrictions on disclosure of educational records.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.10</strong> Within ten (10) working days of the complainant and respondent’s deadline for submitting comments regarding the report, the vice president or his/her designee and the investigator shall meet to discuss the findings, and review the record, including any comments or proposed corrections submitted by the complainant and respondent.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.11</strong> Within ten (10) working days of that meeting, the vice president or his/her designee will take one of the following actions: </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>request further investigation into the complaint;</li>
            <li>dismiss the complaint if the results of the completed investigation are inconclusive or there is insufficient reasonable, credible evidence to support the allegation(s); or</li>
            <li>find that this policy was violated. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A decision that this policy was violated shall be made upon the record provided by the investigator, any comments upon the record provided by the investigator, and any comments submitted by the complainant or respondent; and shall be based on the totality of circumstances surrounding the conduct complained of, including but not limited to the context of that conduct, its severity, and its frequency, whether it was physically threatening, humiliating, or was simply offensive in nature.   Facts will be considered on the basis of what is reasonable to persons of ordinary sensitivity and not on the particular sensitivity or reaction of an individual.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.12</strong> The complainant and the respondent shall be informed in writing by the vice president or his/her designee, of the decision and be provided a copy of the final statement of findings. However, if a complaint is filed against a student, then the complainant may not receive this information, as the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act prohibits such disclosures.</p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.13</strong> If the Vice President or his/her designee determines that this policy was violated, he or she will take disciplinary action that is appropriate for the severity of the conduct. Disciplinary actions can include, but are not limited to, written reprimands, the imposition of conditions, reassignment, suspension, and dismissal. </p>
        <p><strong>3.6.3.14</strong> Implementation of disciplinary action against faculty and employees will be handled in accordance with the University’s policy and procedures for discipline and dismissal of faculty and employees. The Dean of Students will impose disciplinary action, if any, against a student in accordance with the University’s student disciplinary procedures. Where the resolution requires continued monitoring to ensure that the concerns raised have been addressed, the file documenting the complaint will reflect the monitoring plan.</p>
