            <h2>3.2 Participation of Faculty in College and Department Affairs</h2>
            <div class="subSection Level3">
                <h3>3.2.1 Participation in College Affairs</h3>
                <p>Because the Colleges vary in size and professional homogeneity, the degree to which faculty consultation occurs primarily at the college level or the department level may likewise differ. At the same time, coordination among the departments within each College is essential. Accordingly, each Academic Dean, in consultation with the Department Chairs, shall ensure that procedures are developed within the College for faculty consultation and participation in the areas specified below.</p>
                <h3>3.2.2 Participation in Department Affairs</h3>
                <p>Each Academic Dean, in consultation with the Department Chairs, shall ensure that procedures are developed within each department for faculty consultation and participation in the areas specified below.</p>
                <div class="subSection Level4">
                    <p><strong>3.2.2.1</strong> Department faculty shall advise their Chair (by individual consultation or through committees) concerning departmental affairs. The Department Chair is not required to follow the advice, but is expected to receive and consider advice before acting on all major matters. Examples of affairs on which department faculty or their representatives should be consulted include:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>academic matters, including course offerings, degree requirements, course content, and prerequisites;</li>
                        <li>instructional matters, including reasonable departmental guidelines (particularly in courses with multiple sections) concerning textbooks, syllabi, teaching techniques, instructional procedures, grading policies, testing and placement policies; and</li>
                        <li>faculty personnel matters, including appointment of new faculty and evaluation of faculty members for guidance in recommending promotions, re-appointments, tenure status, and salary changes.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>3.2.2.2</strong> The Department Chair shall advise his/her Academic Dean of any serious disagreements by faculty with the Chair's recommendations and policies. In addition, faculty acting individually or as a group may communicate such serious disagreements to the Dean in writing or through informal conference.</p>
                </div><!-- Level4 -->
                <h3>3.2.3 Administrative Organizations</h3>
                <p>The following administrative organizations facilitate the conduct of the official business of the University.</p>
                <div class="subSection Level4">
                    <h4>3.2.3.1 Council of Deans</h4>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>The Council of Deans is composed of the Vice President for Academic Affairs/Provost who shall chair the Council, Associate/Assistant Vice Presidents for Academic Affairs, the Dean of the Graduate School, the Academic Deans, Dean of the University College and the University Librarian;</li>
                        <li>Members of the Council of Deans meet upon call of the chair to consider such matters as need to be discussed. Primarily, the committee functions to ensure inter‑college coordination and uniformity in administering policies affecting faculty and academics programs.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div><!-- Level4 -->
                <h3>3.2.4 Other Institutional University Committees</h3>
                <p>The President, each divisional Vice President and other Administrative Officers may appoint other committees, either to conduct administrative business or to advise on matters of policy, as may be determined for the orderly conduct of University business.</p>
                <h3>3.2.5 College Committees</h3>
                <p>Each Academic Dean has authority to appoint committees within his/her college to facilitate faculty consultation or to give advice on any matter pertaining to the academic programs and administration of the College.</p>

            <h2>3.3 Normal Channels of Information</h2>
            <p>Under normal conditions, recommendations, policy statements, personnel information, grievances, and queries shall move through established administrative lines. Information requiring higher administrative awareness or approval shall move up the line as required. For academic matters, the progression is from faculty member or departmental committee through the Department Chairman, Academic Dean, Head of the Graduate School if necessary, Vice President for Academic Affairs, the President of the University, to The University of Texas System Administration, when appropriate. Non-academic matters shall be transmitted from employee to supervisor(s) or from advisory committee to the administrative officer who appointed the committee and then through normal supervisory channels to the appropriate Vice President, the President and to The University of Texas System, when appropriate. The word "through" is understood to mean that all information and documents may be forwarded with such recommendations as each person deems appropriate, to the highest administrative level required for action or decision.</p>
            <p>Most information originating at higher levels will move down the same lines as required, but announcements and individual inquiries may be made directly.</p>
            <p>Matters requiring action by the Faculty Senate or Standing Committees shall normally be referred to that body by the Academic Deans or higher level Administrative Officers. Matters requiring action by the Graduate Council shall normally be referred to that body by the Head of the Graduate School.</p>
