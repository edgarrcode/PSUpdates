                <h2>5.1 General Provisions</h2>
                <div class="subSection Level3">
                    <h3>5.1.1 Editorial Freedom and Responsibility</h3>
                    The University, as the publisher, must ultimately bear the responsibility for the contents of all official student publications. (For a definition of current student publications, see Section 5.2.1.) This responsibility lies with the Board of Regents of The University of Texas System, the Chief Administrative Officer of the U. T. System, and the President of The University of Texas at El Paso. To insure free, responsible expression, the University delegates publishing responsibilities and authority to a democratically selected Student Publications Committee composed of faculty and students (referred to in the Bylaws of Faculty Government as the Committee on Student Publications.) The Committee in turn delegates to student editors and staff members sufficient autonomy for student publications to maintain their integrity of purpose as vehicles for free inquiry and free expression in an academic community.
                    <h3>5.1.2 Definitions</h3>
                    <p>In addition to definitions provided in Section II, Chapter 1.2 of this Handbook, unless the context requires a different meaning:</p>
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>"Committee" means the Student Publications Committee;</li>
                        <li>"Director" means Director of Student Publications;</li>
                        <li>"Editorial Advisor" means Editorial Advisor/Publications Advisor of Publications;</li>
                        <li>"libel" means any defamation expressed in printing or writing, or by signs, pictures or drawings tending to blacken the memory of the dead, or tending to injure the reputation of one who is alive, and thereby expose him/her to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or financial injury, or virtue, or reputation of anyone, or to publish the natural defects of anyone and thereby expose such a person to public hatred, ridicule, or financial injury (Article 5430, Texas Revised Civil Statutes Annotated [1958]);  (Under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, Chapter 73, Section 73.001, libel is defined as a defamation expressed in written or other graphic form that tends to blacken the memory of the dead or that tends to injure a living person's reputation and thereby expose the person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or financial injury or to impeach any person's honesty, integrity, virtue, or reputation or to publish the natural defects of anyone and thereby expose the person to public hatred, ridicule, or financial injury.)</li>
                        <li>"obscene material" means material, the dominant theme of which, taken as a whole, appeals to prurient interest in sex. The material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters, and is utterly without redeeming social value (Ginzburg v. U.S. 383 U.S. 463 [1966]);</li>
                        <li>"student staff member" means any student working on any student publication as defined in 5.2"Student Publications";</li>
                        <li>"student press" means the student editors and their staff, the Director of Student Publications, the Editorial Advisor to the publications, and the Student Publications Committee;</li>
                        <li>"student publications" means those publications officially recognized by the Student Publications Committee, those currently being the student newspaper, The Prospector, and the student literary magazine,  Rio Grande Review, which are wholly or partially funded from student services fees;</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>A member of the University community who has knowledge of a violation of this chapter may petition the Student Publications Director in writing. If the Student Publications Director does not settle the dispute to the satisfaction of the petitioner, the petitioner may petition the Chair of the Committee, in writing. In such cases, the Chair of the Committee shall act within ten (10) business days from receipt of petition. The Student Publications Director may also initiate a petition directly to the Chair in writing when dereliction of duty or incapacity of anyone on the student staff occurs.
