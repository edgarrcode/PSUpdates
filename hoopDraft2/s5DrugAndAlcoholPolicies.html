<h2>9.1 Drug-Free Work Place Policy</h2>
<p>The  unlawful purchase, manufacture, sale, distribution, possession, storage or use of an illegal drug or controlled substance in or on any premises or property owned or controlled by the University is prohibited. A controlled substance is any substance so defined by federal or state statute or regulation. Any employee who is found guilty (including a plea of no contest) or has a sentence, fine, or other penalty imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction under a criminal statute for an offense involving a controlled substance that occurred in or on premises or property owned or controlled by the University shall report such action to the Human Resource Services Office within 5 days. In accordance with Department of Defense requirements, a supervisor that receives or has actual notice that an employee has engaged in such an offense that results in a finding of guilt, sentence, fine or other penalty as described above will notify the contracting officer within 10 days after receiving the notice and will take corrective action within 30 days if the employee works under a contract that requires the report.  An employee who unlawfully manufactures, sells, distributes, possesses, or uses a controlled substance in or on premises or property owned or controlled by the University, regardless of whether such activity results in the imposition of a penalty under a criminal statute, will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, including termination, or will be required to participate satisfactorily in an approved drug assistance or rehabilitation program or both.</p>
