                <div class="subSection Level3">
                    <h3>2.1.1 Freedom of Speech, Expression, and Assembly</h3>
                    <p>The freedoms of speech, expression, and assembly are fundamental rights of all persons and are central to the mission of the University. Students, faculty, and staff have the right to assemble, to speak, and to attempt to attract the attention of others, and corresponding rights to hear the speech of others when they choose to listen, and to ignore the speech of others when they choose not to listen.</p>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.1.1.1</strong> Students, faculty, and staff are free to express their views, individually or in organized groups, orally or in writing or by other symbols, on any topic, in all parts of the campus, subject only to rules necessary to preserve the equal rights of others and the other functions of the University. Teaching, research, and other official functions of the University shall have priority in allocating the use of space on campus.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.1.1.2</strong> Except as expressly authorized by 2.2, the University shall not discriminate on the basis of the political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic viewpoint expressed by any person, either in the enforcement and administration of these rules or otherwise.</p>
                    </div><!-- Level 4 -->
                    <h3>2.1.2 Scope and Related Provisions</h3>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.1.2.1</strong> This chapter protects and regulates speech, expression, and assembly of students, faculty, and staff that is not part of the teaching, research, or other official functions of the University, not otherwise sponsored by the University or any academic or administrative unit, and not submitted for academic credit.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>2.1.2.2</strong> This chapter also regulates certain speech that is part of the teaching, research, or other official functions of the University:</p>

                            <li>This entire chapter applies to speech by academic and administrative units, and speech that is submitted for academic credit in outdoor locations on the campus. The Dean of Students administers and schedules outdoor signs, tables, exhibits, public assemblies, and amplified sound, even for faculty, staff, and administrative and academic units, because scheduling through a single office is necessary to avoid conflicts.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>2.1.2.3</strong> Any program or event sponsored by an academic or administrative unit of the University shall have priority in the use of space and facilities over any speech, expression and assembly that is not sponsored by an academic or administrative unit, except that programs or events sponsored by an academic or administrative unit shall not have priority in the use of weekday amplified sound areas defined in 2.8.2. Academic or administrative units have equal access to scheduling the amplified sound areas. This chapter does not limit other existing authority of University officials to authorize programs and events sponsored by an academic or administrative unit and not provided for in this chapter.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.1.2.4</strong> Related Regulations and Policies include:</p>

                <div class="subSection Level3">
                    <h3>2.2.1 Obscenity</h3>
                    <p>No person or organization shall distribute or display on the campus any writing or visual image, or engage in any public performance, that is obscene. A writing, image, or performance is "obscene" if it is obscene as defined in Texas Penal Code, Section 21.08 or successor provisions, and is within the constitutional definition of obscenity as set forth in decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>
                    <h3>2.2.2 Defamation</h3>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.2.2.1</strong> No person shall make, distribute, or display on the campus any statement that unlawfully defames any other person.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.2.2.2</strong> A statement unlawfully defames another person if it is false, if the false portion of the statement injures the reputation of the other person, and if the speaker has the constitutionally required state of mind as set forth in decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>

                    <h3>2.2.3 Incitement to Imminent Violations of Law</h3>
                    <p>No person shall make, distribute, or display on the campus any statements directed to inciting or producing imminent violations of law under circumstances such that the statements are likely to actually and imminently incite or produce violations of law.</p>
                    <h3>2.2.4 Harassment</h3>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.2.4.1</strong> No person shall make, distribute, or display on the campus any statement that constitutes verbal harassment of any other person. This section applies to all speech on the campus, including speech that is part of teaching, research, or other official functions of the University. "Verbal harassment" means hostile or offensive speech, oral, written, or symbolic, that:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>personally describes or is personally directed to one or more specific individuals; and</li>
                            <li>is sufficiently severe, pervasive, or persistent to create an objectively hostile environment that interferes with or diminishes the victim's ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or privileges provided by the University; and</li>
                            <li>is not necessary to the expression of any idea described in paragraph 2.2.4.1.1 below.
                            <p><strong>2.2.4.1.1</strong> To make an argument for or against the substance of any political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic idea is not verbal harassment, even if some listeners are offended by the argument or idea. The categories of sexually harassing speech set forth in Section VI: Equal Opportunity of this Handbook are rarely, if ever, necessary to argue for or against the substance of any political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic idea.</p>
                            <p><strong>2.2.4.1.2</strong> Verbal harassment may consist of threats, insults, epithets, ridicule, personal attacks, or the categories of harassing sexual speech set forth in Section VI: Equal Opportunity of this Handbook and is often based on the victim's appearance, personal characteristics, or group membership, including but not limited to race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disability, citizenship, veteran status, sexual orientation, ideology, political views, or political affiliation.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>2.2.4.2</strong> Harassment can also consist of nonverbal conduct, such as hazing, practical jokes, damage to property, and physical assault. In the case of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, sexual conduct is often central to the offense.</p>
                        <p>These forms of harassment are prohibited in this Handbook, Section II: Student Affairs, Chapter 1.3.8; Section VI: Equal Opportunity and in the Regents’ Rules and Regulations, Rule 30105. To the extent of any conflict in the definition of verbal harassment, the more detailed definition in this section controls.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.2.4.3</strong> The harassment that this section chapter prohibits does not exhaust the category of speech that is unnecessary and inappropriate to vigorous debate in a diverse community of educated people. An essential part of higher education is to learn to separate substantive argument from personal offense, and to express even the deepest disagreements within standards of civility that reflect mutual respect, understanding, and sensitivity among the diverse population within the University and in the larger society. These are community norms, even though they cannot be enforced by disciplinary rules.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.2.4.4</strong> Verbal harassment has been interpreted very narrowly by the federal courts. Many University policies on verbal harassment or hate speech have been held unconstitutional, either because they prohibited harassment only when it was based on race, sex, and similar categories, or because they failed to protect the expression of potentially offensive ideas. This policy should be interpreted as narrowly as need be to preserve its constitutionality.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.2.4.5</strong> Complaints about harassment may be reported as follows:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>a student who believes he or she has been harassed should report the alleged violation to the Dean of Students;</li>
                            <li>a faculty member or staff member who believes he or she has been harassed should report the alleged violation to the Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office;</li>
                            <li>alternatively, any person who believes he or she has been harassed may report the alleged violation to the Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office or to any University official, administrator, or supervisor. A faculty member is not an "official, administrator, or supervisor" for this purpose unless that faculty member holds an administrative position;</li>
                            <li>any University official, administrator, or supervisor who receives a report of alleged harassment shall promptly refer that report and the complainant to the Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office, or to the Dean of Students, as appropriate. A complainant whose report is not forwarded to the Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office, or to the Dean of Students, has not initiated proceedings for providing a remedy to the complainant or for imposing discipline on the alleged harasser.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>2.2.4.6</strong> Investigation of the information provided by a complainant, and any subsequent remedial or disciplinary proceedings, shall proceed under the procedures set out in the harassment policies found in Section VI, Equal Opportunity.</p>

                    <h3>2.2.5 Solicitation</h3>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.2.5.1</strong> No person shall make, distribute, or display on the campus any statement that offers or advertises any product or service for sale or lease, or requests any gift or contribution, except as authorized in paragraph (b), by 2.4.3, or by the Regents’ Rules and Regulations, Rule 80103. The following are not solicitation within this definition:</p>

Individual students, faculty members, and staff members may distribute or display such literature, but may not sell it;</li>
                            <li>individual students, faculty members, and staff members may post advertisements for roommates, subleases, and sales of used goods that the seller has personally owned and used, but only on a bulletin board designated for that purpose by an academic or administrative unit in space that the unit occupies or controls. Any unit that designates a bulletin board for this purpose may regulate that bulletin board under the procedures set forth in 2.5.6;</li>
                            <li>a resident of a University residence hall or apartment building may occasionally invite one or more salespersons to come to the resident's room or apartment, and in that room or apartment, the salesperson may offer products or services for sale to other residents of that residence hall or apartment building;</li>

                    <p>Except as expressly authorized in 2.8.2 or by an authorized University official responsible for a program or event sponsored by an academic or administrative unit, no speech, expression, or assembly may be conducted in a way that disrupts or interferes with any:</p>

                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>teaching, research, administration, or other authorized activities on the campus;</li>
                        <li>free and unimpeded flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic on the campus; or</li>
                        <li>signs, tables, exhibits, public assemblies, distribution of literature, guest speakers, or use of amplified sound by another person or organization acting under the rules in this chapter.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.3.1.1</strong> The term "disruption" and its variants, as used in this rule, are distinct from and broader than the phrase "disruptive activities," as used in the Regents’ Rules and Regulations, Rules 30103 and 40502. This rule is concerned not only with deliberate disruption, but also with scheduling and coordination of events to manage or minimize the inevitable conflicts between legitimate events conducted in close proximity.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.3.1.2</strong> Except in the most extreme cases, interference and disruption are unavoidably contextual. Intentional physical interference with other persons is nearly always disruptive in any context. Interfering with traffic depends on the relation between the volume of traffic and the size of the passageway left open. Disruptive noise is the most contextual of all, because it depends on the activity disrupted. Any distracting sound may disrupt a memorial service. Any sound sufficiently loud or persistent to make concentration difficult may disrupt a class or library. Occasional heckling in the speaker's pauses may not disrupt a political speech, but persistent heckling that prevents listeners from hearing the speaker does disrupt a political speech. These illustrations may be helpful, but none of them includes enough context to be taken as a rule. We cannot escape relying on the judgment and fairness of University authorities in particular cases. In this context where difficult enforcement judgments are unavoidable, it is especially important to remind administrators and law enforcement officials that their judgments should not be influenced by the viewpoint of those claiming disruption or of those allegedly disrupting.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.3.1.3</strong> Potentially disruptive events can often proceed without disruption if participants, administrators, and law enforcement officials cooperate to avoid disruption without stopping the event. In cases of marginal or unintentional disruption, administrators and law enforcement officials should clearly state what they consider disruptive and seek voluntary compliance before stopping the event or resorting to disciplinary charges or arrest.</p>

                        <p><strong>2.3.2.1</strong> No speech, expression, or assembly may be conducted in a way that damages or defaces property of the University or of any person who has not authorized the speaker to damage or deface his or her property.</p>

                    <p>Neither registered student, faculty, or staff organizations, nor individual students, faculty, or staff, may co-sponsor any event on campus with an off-campus person or organization. Only academic or administrative units with authority delegated from the President of the University may co-sponsor events with an off-campus person or organization.</p>

                        <p><strong>2.3.4.1</strong> An event is a prohibited co-sponsorship if an individual or a student, faculty, or staff organization:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>depends on an off-campus person or organization for planning, staffing, or management of the event; or</li>
                            <li>advertises the event as cosponsored by an off-campus person or organization; or</li>
                            <li>operates the event as agent of, or for the benefit of, an off-campus person or organization, except for solicitation of charitable contributions under the authority of 2.2.5.2(a); or</li>
                            <li>distributes any proceeds of the event to an off-campus person or organization, except for A. the proceeds of charitable contributions solicited under the authority of 2.2.5.2(a); or</li>
                            <li>payment of a fair market price for goods or services provided to the University person or organization; or</li>
                            <li>reserves a room or space for the use of an off-campus person or organization; or</li>
                            <li>engages in any other behavior that persuades the Dean of Students that an off-campus person or organization is in fact responsible for the event, in full or in substantial part.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>2.3.4.2</strong> The following facts do not, in and of themselves, indicate a prohibited co-sponsorship:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>That a University person or organization endorses an off- campus person or organization or its message;</li>
                            <li>That a University person or organization sells, distributes, or displays literature prepared by an off-campus person or organization or containing contact information for an off-campus person or organization;</li>
                            <li>That a University person or organization has purchased goods or services from an off-campus provider;</li>
                            <li>That a registered student, faculty, or staff organization has invited a guest speaker under 2.10;</li>
                            <li>That a registered student, faculty, or staff organization has received financial contributions to support the event from an off-campus donor.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>2.3.4.3</strong> The purpose of this rule is to preserve the limited space on campus for the use of students, faculty, and staff, and the rule shall be interpreted to serve that purpose. It is not the purpose of this rule to prevent students, faculty, or staff from exercising their right to associate with other persons or organizations holding views similar to their own.</p>
                    </div><!-- Level 4 -->
                    <h3>2.3.5 Other Rules with Incidental Effects on Speech</h3>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.3.5.1</strong> Other generally applicable or narrowly localized rules, written and unwritten, incidentally limit the time, place, and manner of speech, but are too numerous to compile or cross-reference here. For example, libraries typically have highly restrictive rules concerning noise; laboratories and rooms containing the electrical and mechanical infrastructure of the University typically have safety rules and rules excluding persons without specific business there; fire and safety codes prohibit the obstruction of exits and limit the constriction of hallways. Speech within classrooms is generally confined to the subject matter of the class; the right to attend a class at all is subject to registration and payment of tuition; individual professors may have rules of decorum in their classroom. These kinds of rules limit the right of students, faculty, and staff to enter and speak in the places to which these rules apply.</p>

                        <p><strong>2.3.5.2</strong> Reasonable and nondiscriminatory rules of this kind generally control over the rights of free speech guaranteed in this chapter. But even these kinds of rules are subject to the constitutional right of free speech. Such rules must be viewpoint neutral. Such rules cannot regulate speech more restrictively than they regulate other activities that cause the problems to be avoided by the rule. Such rules should not restrict speech more than is reasonably necessary to serve their purpose. Such rules cannot ban unobtrusive forms of communication with no potential for disruption even in the specialized environment subject to the localized rule. Thus, for example, means of silent expression or protest confined to the speaker's immediate person, such as armbands, buttons, and t-shirts, are nearly always protected because they are rarely disruptive in any environment.</p>

                        <p><strong>2.9.2.1</strong> University persons or organizations who wish to publicly assemble in a particular room or space at a particular time may reserve the room or space under the provisions in 3.2.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.9.2.2</strong> An organization with a reservation has the right to the reserved room or space for the time covered by the reservation. Any person or organization using or occupying the room or space without a reservation must yield control of the room or space in time to permit any organization with a reservation to begin using the room or space promptly at the beginning of its reserved time.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.9.2.3</strong> Reservations are not required but are strongly encouraged. A person or organization planning to use a room or space without a reservation may find the facility locked or in use by another person or organization. The University Police rely on a list of scheduled events, and a large group without a reservation is likely to attract their courteous but inquiring attention.</p>

Persons or organizations planning smaller assemblies are encouraged to consult the Dean of Students if there is uncertainty about applicable University rules, the appropriateness of the planned location, or possible conflict with other events. The Dean has much experience in helping student organizations structure events in ways that both comply with the University's rules and achieve the organization's goals for the event. The Dean can help identify appropriate space and potentially conflicting events. The Dean can help the planners avoid unintended disruption or other violations that may result in subsequent discipline or subsequent interference with the assembly by campus authorities.</p>

The normal patrolling of officers during regular duty areas in the area of such events will be at the cost of the University. When the magnitude, timing, or nature of an event requires overtime hours from police officers (including contract hours for officers hired from other departments or private security agencies), the University will, to the extent specified in 2.12.12 and 2.12.13, charge the cost of overtime or contract officers to the person or organization sponsoring the event or exhibit that requires overtime police protection. The purpose of 2.12.12 and 2.12.13 is to charge for police overtime where reasonably possible, but not to charge for police overtime made necessary by the content of speech at the event or by the controversy associated with any event.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.12.1.2</strong> A reasonable and nondiscriminatory fee for overtime police work will be charged for events that require overtime police protection, and charge a price for admission, or pay a speaker, band, or other off-campus person or organization for services at the event.</p>
                        <p>Persons or organizations planning such events should budget for the cost of police protection.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.12.1.3</strong> The University shall have the sole power to decide, after reasonable consultation with the person or organization planning the event, whether and to what extent overtime police protection is required. No fee shall be charged for officers assigned because of political, religious, philosophical, ideological, or academic controversy anticipated or actually experienced at the event. All fees shall be based on the number of officers required for an uncontroversial event of the same size and kind, in the same place and at the same time of day, handling the same amount of cash.</p>

                    <h3>2.12.3 Appeals</h3>
                    <div class="subSection Level4">
                        <p><strong>2.12.3.1</strong> A person or organization that is denied permission for an activity requiring advance permission under this chapter may appeal the denial of permission.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.12.3.2</strong> A person or organization that complies with an on-the-scene order limiting speech, expression, or assembly may, on or before the fifth weekday after complying with the order, file an appeal to determine the propriety of the order limiting the speech, expression, or assembly. The question on appeal shall be whether, under the circumstances as they reasonably appeared at the time of the order, the appellant's speech, expression, or assembly should have been permitted to continue. Such an appeal may be useful to clarify the meaning of a rule, or to resolve a factual dispute that may recur if the appellant desires to resume the speech, expression, or assembly that was limited by the order.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.12.3.3</strong> An appeal authorized by this section shall be heard under the procedures set out in 3.4 below.</p>
