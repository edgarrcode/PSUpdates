<p>University employees are placed into one of the following four categories:</p> 
<ol type="a">
    <li>Faculty </li>
    <li>Administrative and Professional</li>
    <li>Classified Staff</li>
    <li>Student Employees</li>
</ol>


<hr>
<h2>1.1 Faculty</h2>
<p>The regular academic ranks are Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, and Instructor. Only full-time service in these ranks will be counted toward fulfillment of the tenure probationary period, and only members of the faculty with the academic titles of Professor, Associate Professor, or Assistant Professor may be granted tenure in accordance with Section III, Chapter 4, Academic Policies and Faculty Personnel Matters, of this Handbook.</p>


<hr>
<h2>1.2 Administrative and Professional (A/P)</h2>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Positions whose incumbent serves as the head or director of a non-academic department or budget entity, is appointed by and serves at the pleasure of the President or his or her delegate, and prepares and administers the policies, programs, and internal procedures of the department;</li> 
    <li>positions whose incumbent serves as an assistant or associate department head or director and who participates in the management of the department or a major functional segment thereof, and performs the duties and responsibilities of the department head or director in the latter's absence;</li> 
    <li>positions whose incumbents perform duties solely or preponderantly of a recognized and state-licensed profession requiring a doctoral degree such as lawyers, physicians, opticians, veterinarians, etc.;</li> 
    <li>positions, such as those of professional librarians, which are excluded by law from the Classified Service;</li> 
    <li>positions whose incumbents are employed to perform specialized functions, such as athletic coaches;</li>
    <li>positions which require an incumbent to possess a national reputation or status in their field or unusual or unique and highly specialized expertise in a particular area or field of endeavor.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>1.3 Classified Staff</h2>
<p>All Classified staff personnel will be assigned a position title contained in the University Classified Pay Plan on the basis of responsibility of work to be performed. Each position title in the Classified Pay Plan carries a salary range that has been established to make provision for salary progression within each classification on the basis of merit and other such factors as may be prescribed. Internal equity was achieved based upon job content and without regard to the incumbent or the incumbent's performance. A hierarchy of jobs is the result, ranging from lesser to higher levels of difficulty. Standardized job descriptions and salary ranges are developed for each job classification. Salary ranges are established to be both internally equitable and externally competitive. All staff positions must be classified in a manner which properly reflects the level of responsibility of the work to be performed. A supervisor may not change the duties and responsibilities of a job that would change the position's classification without prior administrative approval as provided for in 2.5, below.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>1.3.1 Probationary Service Required</h3>
    All newly assigned classified employees at the University are required to satisfy a probationary period of 180 (one hundred eighty) calendar days from the beginning date of employment. The probationary period begins on the first day of assignment. If an employee is placed on leave without pay during the probationary period, then the probationary period is extended by the same number of days that the employee is on leave.
    The probationary period allows the supervisor to observe and evaluate a new employee’s performance and permits the employee to adjust to the job and working conditions.  
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <h4>1.3.1.1 Evaluation of Probationary Service</h4>
        <p>Supervisors must evaluate the work performance of the probationary employee prior to the end of the 180 calendar day probationary period, or prior to any decision to terminate the employee during the probationary period, using an approved University employee performance evaluation form. However, it is recommended that the evaluation be conducted as of the 90th day of employment or sooner, especially if there are performance concerns. This makes the employee aware that improvements are necessary.  Any information concerning the employee’s performance during the probationary period should be discussed with the employee and documented in the employee’s personnel file.</p> 
        <h4>1.3.1.2 Termination of Probationary Employment</h4>
        <p>Subject to review and approval of the Office of Human Resource Services the employment of any probationary employee whose performance is judged to be unsatisfactory may be terminated without prior notice. A classified employee terminated during the probationary period does not have access to the discipline and dismissal policies and procedures of the University.</p>   
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    <h3>1.3.2 Probationary Policy for Transfer </h3>
    <p>A transfer, promotion, or demotion of a classified employee, to a position within the university, begins a new probationary period of 180 calendar days. The probationary period is established to allow the supervisor to observe and evaluate the employee’s performance in the new position and ensure that the employee selected for the new position meets the minimum performance standards of the job.</p>
    <p>The employee, as a general rule, must satisfactorily complete a probationary period of 180 calendar days with no disciplinary action beyond a Verbal Warning in order to be eligible for a subsequent transfer, promotion, or demotion from (or within) the current department.</p> 
    <p>The restriction from applying for other positions within the University while satisfying a probationary period of 180 calendar days may be waived however, at the discretion of the University under the following circumstances:</p>   
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>1.3.2.1</strong> When the assignment for which the classified employee was hired is due to end prior to the completion of the 180 calendar day probationary period;</p>
        <p><strong>1.3.2.2</strong> When the outcome of a department’s reorganization and/or job reclassification creates a change in the resulting duties, pay, work schedule, and/or reporting structure;.</p>
        <p><strong>1.3.2.3</strong> When the probationary employee is in a temporary position and a full-time job opportunity becomes available.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
</div><!-- Level3 -->


<hr>
<h2>1.4 Student Employees</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <p><strong>1.4.1</strong> A student employee is defined as a person who is enrolled full-time in a degree or certificate program at The University of Texas at El Paso and is also employed part-time by the University at any time during the period of enrollment. A person enrolled full-time as a student in a degree, certificate, or other course of study at the University may not also be employed full-time by the University during the period of enrollment unless the supervising administrative official has certified that such enrollment will not conflict with the employee's assigned duties and the enrollment has been reviewed and approved by the Human Resource Services Office.  The workload of a student employee may not exceed nineteen (19) hours per week. Student employees are not eligible for paid leaves or holidays and are not entitled to use the regular employee appeals and grievance procedures. Additional information relative to job code and title, rate of pay, type of pay rate, and maximum hours and time permitted to work for student employees is contained in the current University Classified Pay Plan. </p>
    <p><strong>1.4.2</strong> A full-time employee who is also enrolled part-time in credit classes at the University is not deemed to be a student employee and is subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to any other classified employee.</p>
