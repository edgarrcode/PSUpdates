            <div class="mainContent">

<p>This policy governs the disclosure of individual significant financial interests and the management and reporting of an individual financial conflict of interest in research performed at The University of Texas at El Paso (University).</p>
<p>This policy provides requirements for the disclosure of financial interests that comply with the disclosure requirements of federal regulations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the HHS Public Health Service, but this policy is not limited in application to PHS-funded research.  Rather, this policy applies broadly to research performed at the University, without regard to whether the research has external funding and, if externally funded, regardless of the funding source.  For this purpose, “research” means any systematic investigation, study, or experiment designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge.  The term includes both basic and applied research and product development.</p>
<p>This policy applies in addition to general University policies, such as policies on standards of conduct, as well as other policies governing disclosure of activities and financial interests. </p>
<p>If a specific federal law or regulation provides different requirements than this policy, the more stringent requirement applies.</p>
<hr>
<h2>2.1 General Provisions</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>2.1.1 Who is Covered: “Covered Individual”</h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.1.1.1</strong> An individual who, regardless of title or position, is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research, including a principal investigator, co-investigator, or project director, must file and update financial disclosure statements under this policy.  A person required to file and update financial disclosure statements is referred to in this policy as a “covered individual.”</p>
        <p><strong>2.1.1.2</strong> A student enrolled at the University who is responsible for the design, conduct, or reporting of research that is not PHS-funded is considered to be a “covered individual” under this policy only if the student has a significant financial interest that appears to be affected by the research or is in an entity whose financial interest appears to be affected by the research.  A student who is in doubt about whether the student is a “covered individual” must request a determination by the conflict of interest official appointed under Section 2.3.1.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    <h3>2.1.2 Collaborators and Contractors</h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.1.2.1</strong> If research is carried out in cooperation with or through a subrecipient (e.g. a subcontractor, contractor, or collaborator), this University will enter into a written agreement with the contracting party that provides legally enforceable terms that establish whether this policy or the financial conflicts of interest policy of the contracting party applies to the researchers of the contracting party.</p>
        <p><strong>2.1.2.2</strong> If the policy of the contracting party applies to its researchers, the contracting party must certify that its policy is consistent with the requirements of any applicable federal regulations.  If the contracting party cannot so certify, the agreement must state that the researchers are subject to this policy as covered individuals for disclosing significant financial interests that are directly related to the researcher’s work at this University.</p>
        <p><strong>2.1.2.3</strong> If the policy of the contracting party applies to its researchers, the agreement must specify the time periods for the contracting party to report identified financial conflicts of interest to this University.  The time periods must be sufficient for this University to make any reports required by federal regulation.</p>
        <p><strong>2.1.2.4</strong> If the policy of this University applies to the researchers of the contracting party, the agreement must specify the time periods for the researchers to submit a financial interest disclosure statement to this University.  The time periods must be sufficient for this University to comply with its review, management, and reporting obligations under federal regulation.</p>
    </div><!-- Level4 -->
    <h3>2.1.3 Education </h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.1.3.1</strong> Each covered individual must acknowledge annually that the individual is aware of and has read this policy and is aware of the covered individual’s responsibilities regarding disclosure of significant financial interests and of applicable federal regulations.
        <p><strong>2.1.3.2</strong> A covered individual must complete training in regard to this policy and applicable policies, regulations, and laws before engaging in research at the University and at least once every four years thereafter.  A covered individual who is new to the University must complete the training before engaging in research at the institution or provide evidence of having completed the training at another institution of The University of Texas System within the last four years.  A covered individual must complete the training immediately if the University finds that the individual is not in compliance with this policy or the individual’s management plan, or if the University revises this policy in a manner that affects the individual’s duties.

        <p><strong>2.4.1.1</strong> If the conflict of interest official determines that a covered individual has a financial conflict of interest, the official, in cooperation with the covered individual and other appropriate individuals designated by the conflict of interest official and/or  conflict of interest committee, shall develop a management plan governing that conflict of interest.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4.1.2</strong> If research is ongoing and a new covered individual discloses a significant financial interest related to that research or any other covered individual discloses a new significant financial interest related to that research, the conflict of interest official shall, not later than the 60th day after the filing of the disclosure statement:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>review the disclosure statement to determine if a financial conflict of interest exists; and</li>
            <li>if a financial conflict of interest exists, implement an interim management plan or implement other interim measures to ensure the objectivity of the research.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2.4.1.3</strong> If the conflict of interest official and/or conflict of interest committee learns of a significant financial interest that was not timely disclosed or was not timely reviewed, the conflict of interest official shall, not later than the 60th day after learning of the interest:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>determine whether the significant financial interest is a financial conflict of interest; and
            <li>if a financial conflict of interest exists, implement an interim management plan or implement other interim measures to ensure the objectivity of the research going forward.
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2.4.1.4</strong> In addition, if a financial conflict of interest was not timely identified or managed, or if a covered individual fails to comply with a management plan, the conflict of interest official shall, not later than the 120th day after determining noncompliance:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>complete and document a retrospective review and determination as to whether research conducted during the period of noncompliance was biased in the design, conduct, or reporting of the research; and</li>
            <li>implement any measures necessary with regard to the covered individual’s participation in the research between the date that the noncompliance is identified and the date the retrospective review is completed.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2.4.1.5</strong> For PHS-covered research projects, the retrospective review shall cover key elements as specified by federal regulations and may result in updating the Financial Conflict of Interest Report, notifying the PHS, and submitting a mitigation report as required by federal regulation.</p>

    <h3>2.4.2 Management Plan Design and Agreement</h3>
    <div class="subSection Level4">
        <p><strong>2.4.2.1</strong> A management plan may impose conditions and prescribe actions necessary to manage a financial conflict of interest, including an action reducing or eliminating the financial conflict of interest, to ensure that the design, conduct, or reporting of the research is free from bias or the appearance of bias.   Examples of conditions or actions that may be prescribed include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>public disclosure of the conflict of interest in presentations and publications;</li>
                <li>for human subjects research, direct disclosure of the conflict of interest to research participants;</li>
                <li>appointment of an independent monitor with authority to take measures to protect the design, conduct, and reporting of research against bias, or the appearance of bias, resulting from the conflict of interest;</li>
                <li>modification of the research plan;</li>
                <li>change of personnel or personnel responsibilities, or disqualification of personnel from participation in all or a portion of the research;</li>
                <li>divesture or reduction of the financial interest; or</li>
                <li>severance of relationships that create an actual or potential financial conflict of interest.</li>
            </ol>
        <p><strong>2.4.2.2</strong> A management plan must be in the form of a written agreement and must:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>provide that the covered individual acknowledges receipt of the plan and understands the requirements of this policy and understands and agrees to comply with the required actions and other terms of the plan, including the time frames for required actions; and</li>
            <li>clearly identify each specific person responsible for monitoring compliance with the management plan.  </li>
            </ol>
