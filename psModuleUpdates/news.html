<h2 id="NewHireRehireIAPForm">New Hire/Rehire IAP Form New Functionality</h2>
<p class="caption">September 2, 2014 | <a href="#theTop">Back to top</a></p>
<p>In order to confirm that an employee funded through a grant has sufficient funding for the duration of their appointment, new fields were added to the New Hire/Rehire IAP form. When a grant funding source is entered, project begin/end date fields will now auto-populate. If the funding source begin and end dates that you enter do not fall within the project begin/end date timeframe, a different or additional funding source must be added to fund the remaining duration of the appointment.</p> 
 
<p>For example, Paydirt Pete’s appointment is from 9/1/14 to 5/31/15. If the grant that funds his appointment ends on 12/31/14, a second funding source must be entered to fund the 1/1/15 to 5/31/15 period. Below is an example of how his funding would be assigned:</p>

        </tr>

<p class="caption">August 22, 2014 | <a href="#theTop">Back to top</a></p>
<p>In order to ensure that all hourly employees have an active appointment for the fall semester and can receive their first paycheck on September 17, please process their New Hire/Rehire IAP form <strong>no later than September 5 at 5:00 p.m.</strong> </p>
<p>To identify your hourly employees with an 08/31/14 end date in PeopleSoft:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to Main <strong>Menu&gt;Workforce Administration&gt;Job Information&gt;Current Job</strong></li>
    <li>Search for your hourly employee. </li>
    <li>Under the <strong>Work Location tab</strong>, view the <strong>Expected Job End Date</strong> field. </li>
</ol>
<p>After you have identified hourly employees with an 08/31/14 end date, review with management to determine which employees need to have their appointment extended. When completing the New Hire/Rehire IAP form, make sure to enter 09/01/14 as the new start date. New Hire/Rehire IAP forms need to have account owner approval by <strong>September 5 at 5:00 p.m.</strong> </p>
<p>Note: If you have already processed IAP forms to hire or extend appointments for hourly employees for the fall, you do not need to do so again. </p>

<p>Off-cycle payroll requests will now be processed twice a week. A department can submit an Off-Cycle Payroll Request form to pay employees who have a position and appointment entered in PeopleSoft, but have not received a paycheck payment through no fault of their own. </p>
<p>You can find the Off-Cycle Payroll Request form on <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/financialservicesforms">Forms Mine</a>, under the Payroll Forms drop-down menu. Off-Cycle Payroll Request forms must be submitted to the Payroll Office.</p>

<h2 id="PeopleSoftCascading">PeopleSoft Cascading</h2>
<p class="caption">August 11, 2014 | <a href="#theTop">Back to top</a></p>
<p>Cascading refers to an action that the PeopleSoft system takes when the amount of leave time that is submitted for an employee is more than what the employee has available. The system will automatically “cascade,” and attempt to pull leave from another leave type to compensate for the difference. </p>
<p>In collaboration with our partners and UT Share, the decision was made to not include Compensation Time and Overtime in the cascading order for Vacation, Educational Activities, and Sick leave in PeopleSoft. </p>
<p><a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/training/documents/Time%20Reporting/Cascading_Order.pdf">Click here</a> to see a table of the updated cascading order for each leave type. The change affects cascading for leave taken after July 16.</p>

<p class="caption">June 12, 2014 | <a href="#theTop">Back to top</a></p>
<p>In order to process a payment for a student who is not an employee, submit a hard copy, or fax a completed Student Information Form to the Accounts Payable Office. The Accounts Payable Office will enter the student in PeopleSoft. </p>
<p>After the student has been entered into the system, departments can proceed to process a payment using the Vendor Payment or Employee Reimbursement IAP form, depending on the type of payment the student should receive. Please note that this process does not apply to financial aid or payroll payments. </p>
<p>The Student Information Form is located on the <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=72902">Resources</a> page of the PeopleSoft informational website and on <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?alias=admin.utep.edu/financialservicesforms">Forms Mine</a>.

<p class="caption">June 4, 2014 | <a href="#theTop">Back to top</a></p>
<p>In order to expedite the processing of travel &amp; expense and vendor payment transactions in PeopleSoft, departments are to send both a hard copy of the PeopleSoft document and a hard copy of the <strong>department-approved</strong> IAP form to the Accounts Payable Office. Only the <strong>first page</strong> of the IAP form and the PeopleSoft document need to be sent to the Accounts Payable Office. Please continue to upload supporting documentation to the IAP form or send documents to the Accounts Payable Office along with the hard copies. See below for instructions on sending hard copy documentation.</p>

</ul>
<p>The revised process only applies to employee reimbursements (travel &amp; non-travel), and vendor (non-PO voucher) payments. As a reminder, in order for payments to be processed you must submit both an approved IAP form and a matching PeopleSoft document.  </p>

<p>In order to expedite budget transfer processing, departments will no longer enter budget transfers directly in PeopleSoft. After the department submits the Budget Transfer Request interim approval process (IAP) form, and it is approved, the Budget Office will enter the budget transfer directly in PeopleSoft. The department will receive notification once the budget transfer is processed.</p>
<p>Grants budget transfers will continue to be entered directly in PeopleSoft by the Contracts &amp; Grants Office.</p>

<p>In order to streamline HR request processing, required fields for funding information were added to the interim approval process (IAP) New Hire/Rehire form. As a result, departments no longer need to submit an IAP Position Funding Changes form to request that funding be added to a position. The Position Funding Changes form will be used solely for requesting that changes be made to a position’s funding source. </p>

<h2 id="CollectingApprovalsEnteringTransactionsinPeopleSoft">Collecting Approvals &amp; Entering Transactions in PeopleSoft</h2>
<p class="caption">May 16, 2014 | <a href="#theTop">Back to top</a></p>
<p>Currently there is no functionality to route a document for approval in PeopleSoft. For this reason, approvals for common HR and Finance transactions have to be collected outside of PeopleSoft before the transaction can be entered in PeopleSoft. In order to get your transaction processed, the following steps have to be taken:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Initiate an interim approval process (IAP) form to collect data and approvals for a transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once all approvals have been collected, the transaction can be entered in PeopleSoft. </p>
<p><strong>Remember, initiating an IAP form will not automatically populate data in PeopleSoft. This step needs to be done by the department or a central processing unit (i.e. Accounts Payable/Travel, HR, etc.), depending on the type of transaction. To see who is responsible for entering HR and Finance transactions in PeopleSoft, <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=73859">click here</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Correlating IAP Forms with PeopleSoft Documents</strong></p>
<p>For internal control  purposes, central processing units cannot final approve a transaction entered in PeopleSoft unless it matches information in an IAP form. Critical information such as accounting details, amounts, dates, itemized line items, etc. should be the same in both documents. If data does not match, transactions cannot be processed.</p>

<h2 id="NeedtoKnowsforProcessingTravelVendorPayments">“Need to Knows” for Processing Travel &amp; Vendor Payments</h2>
<p class="caption">May 15, 2014 | <a href="#theTop">Back to top</a></p>
<p><strong>Correlating IAP Forms with PeopleSoft Documents</strong></p>
<p>As you know, information in IAP forms needs to match information that is entered in PeopleSoft. IAP forms for travel authorizations, employee reimbursements, and vendor payments all have a unique system-generated number called a DTN. To help us correlate PeopleSoft documents with their respective IAP forms, please include the IAP DTN when you enter a transaction in PeopleSoft. Quick guides are available for locating and adding DTN information for <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/training/documents/Vendor%20Payments/DTNQuickGuideVendor.pdf">Vendor Payments</a>, <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/training/documents/Travel%20and%20Expense%20Reimbursements/DTNQuickGuideTravel.pdf">Travel Authorizations</a>, and <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Portals/1878/training/documents/Travel%20and%20Expense%20Reimbursements/DTNQuickGuideEmployeeReimbursement.pdf">Employee Reimbursements</a>.</p>
<h3>Expense Reimbursements</h3>
<h4>Itemizing Employee Reimbursements</h4>
<p>To add multiple line items in the Employee Reimbursement IAP form, click on the “Add Line Item” button. Remember, line items and cost center/project IDs in the IAP form need to match line items that are entered in PeopleSoft.</p>
<h4>Rounding Travel Mileage</h4>
<p>When entering travel mileage in either the IAP form or PeopleSoft, round up to the nearest whole mile. For example, if the traveler traveled 23.3 miles, round up to 24 miles. </p>
<h3>Travel Authorizations</h3>
<h4>Airfare</h4>
<p>When creating a travel authorization through the IAP form or through PeopleSoft, do not include airfare charges. Airfare is charged directly through the University’s ghost card, and allocated through the Travel Office. </p>
<h4>Payment Type</h4>
<p>When creating a travel authorization in PeopleSoft, always select “Paid By Employee” for the Payment Type under the Details section.</p>
<h4>Entering Authorization IDs in Concur </h4>
<p>The Authorization ID that needs to be entered in Concur is made up of two parts: TV (travel authorization type) followed by the Authorization ID generated in PeopleSoft. Do not include any extra spaces between the travel authorization type and the PeopleSoft Authorization ID. The following is an example of what the Authorization ID in Concur would look like: TV0000002609. </p>

<p>Grant projects are now available for processing HR and Finance transactions! You may now begin to process all pending HR and Finance transactions such as hires, travel documents, vendor expenses, budget transfer, purchase orders, etc.</p>
<p>Please keep the following points in mind during this transitional period:</p>
<ul>
    <li>As with any other project or cost center (formerly “account” in DEFINE), the expenses in Budget Overview are as of March 2014.  April expenses will be converted to PeopleSoft by mid-month.  Be conservative with purchases to reduce the risk of overspending your grants budget.</li>
    <li>There are new grants budget items in PeopleSoft;   though they may appear differently from DEFINE, the total budget is the same.  </li>
    <li>If you have questions on the mapping of expense types to new budget items, please view the Grants Define Object Codes crosswalk in our PeopleSoft Training Documents page (under the Grants  section).</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, all approvals need to be collected through <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=73859">interim approval processes</a> before the transaction can be processed in PeopleSoft. If you need assistance processing HR or Finance transactions, contact the Help Desk by emailing <a href="mailto:helpdesk@utep.edu">helpdesk@utep</a>.edu, or calling extension 4357 (off-campus: 747-5257).

<p>When PeopleSoft goes live, interim approval processes will be put in place to collect approvals for common HR and Finance transactions. Departments will initiate the collection of approvals through either a paper or electronic method outside of the PeopleSoft system.  </p>
<p><strong>Entering Transactions in PeopleSoft</strong></p>
<p>After approvals are collected outside of PeopleSoft, the department may also be responsible for entering the transaction into PeopleSoft. Note: Not all transactions will be entered in PeopleSoft by the department; certain transactions will be entered by the central processing units (Human Resources, Payroll, Budget, etc.).</p>
