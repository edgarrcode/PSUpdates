                    <p>A department may determine that it is reasonable and necessary to pay the relocation expenses of an employee. The appropriate Vice President must approve the reimbursement and funds must be available in the account charged.</p>
                    <p>The reimbursement of relocation expenses may not be paid with State appropriated funds (reference General Appropriations Act, 74th Legislature, HB1, Article 9, Section 18). The department will be required to use local (non-state appropriated) funds. The move must be business related and expenses must be substantiated as stated by the accountable plan rules. Reimbursement will not be allowed for amounts in excess of actual expenses incurred.</p>
                    <p>The Payroll Office will determine the amount of employee relocation expenses that are excludable from the employee's gross income and report them as such on the employee’s W-2. See IRS Publication 521 - Moving Expenses for more detail.</p>

                    <h2 class="aTitle"><span>Reimbursement Criteria and Limits</span></h2>
                    <p>Relocation expenses may be reimbursed to faculty or administrative and professional staff positions for a total amount approved not to exceed actual expenses as determined by each individual department.</p>
                    <p>Employer paid qualified moving expenses may be excluded from income as Section 132 fringe benefits. Federal income tax and FICA do not need to be withheld. Payments related to moving an employee that do not satisfy the definition of a “qualified moving expense” are not section 132 fringe benefits and are subject to federal income tax withholding and FICA.</p>
                    <p>The following list provides examples of reimbursable costs and their taxability:</p>

                    <h2 class="aTitle"><span>Non-taxable Moving Expenses:</span></h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reasonable transportation costs for employee and family</li>
                        <li>Reasonable costs of moving household goods and personal effects for employee and family</li>
                        <li>Reasonable costs for lodging en route for the employee and their family</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="aTitle"><span>Taxable Moving Expenses:</span></h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>House hunting trips prior to the actual move</li>
                        <li>Temporary living expenses at the new location</li>
                        <li>All Meal expenses including those while en route to the new location</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="aTitle"><span>Reimbursement Procedures</span></h2>
                    <p>The department must include the amount of reimbursable moving expenses within the employees Official Offer Letter. The Offer Letter should state the agreed maximum amount for relocation expense reimbursement and be signed by the appropriate Vice President.</p>
                    <p>The department submits a Moving Expense Reimbursement Form to the Payroll Office. The moving expense reimbursement form must include a copy of the official Offer Letter given to the employee, original receipts, the employee's signature and the authorized signature for the account to be charged.</p>
                    <p>The Moving Expense Reimbursement Form and supporting documentation will be reviewed to determine what expenses, if any, are taxable. If there are no taxable expenses, a check will be issued. If any of the expenses are determined to be taxable, reimbursement of those expenses, less applicable taxes, will be paid on the next available semi-monthly payroll.</p>
                    <p>Non-Taxable moving expense reimbursements will be reported in Box 12 of the employee's W-2, Code P.</p>

                    <h2 class="aTitle"><span>Moving Vendor Direct Payment Option</span></h2>
                    <p>A department may choose to pay for an employee's moving expenses (services performed by a moving company) by direct vendor payment. The University utilizes a moving contract through the E & I Cooperative and employees are encouraged to obtain quotes from Allied and United Van Lines. Additional insurance beyond the normal liability of the moving company will not be provided.</p>
                    <p>The employee should work with the hiring department in submitting the moving company’s payment information at least two weeks prior to the intended move. A purchase order will be submitted to the firm indicating the University’s agreement to pay up to the maximum authorized amount. When the move is complete, the employee will be responsible for any expenses in excess of the stipulated maximum allowance. The moving company will then invoice the University directly for the maximum authorized dollar amount or the total dollar amount if less than the maximum authorized. The University assumes no responsibility for the household goods, personal effects, or property of the employee. In the event a dispute arises between the moving company and the employee, responsibility for resolving the matter rests with the employee.</p>
                    <p>If any portion of the reimbursement is determined to be taxable, the value of the taxable portion of the reimbursement will be included in the employee's gross income and the appropriate taxes will be withheld.</p>
                    <p>The department requesting reimbursement should include the Purchase Order number or Department Requisition Number on the Moving Expense Reimbursement Form.</p>
