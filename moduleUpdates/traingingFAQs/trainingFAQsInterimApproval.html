<div class="accordion">
<h3>Why are we using interim approval processes?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
When PeopleSoft goes live, approval routing (workflow) functionality will be disabled for common HR and finance transactions. We will use interim approval processes (IAP) outside of the PeopleSoft system in order to collect approvals for common HR and Finance transactions. Once approvals are collected, the transaction will be processed directly in PeopleSoft.</p>
</div>
<h3>How will approvals be collected?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
In most cases, departments will collect approvals by paper or through an electronic interim IAP form outside of the PeopleSoft system.</p>
</div>
<h3>Who will process transactions directly in PeopleSoft?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
In most cases, the central processing units will process transactions directly in PeopleSoft, though there are some instances where the department will be responsible for entering the transaction in PeopleSoft.

<h3>Are all interim approval processes electronic?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
No; some HR and Finance transactions will require a paper process. To see a list of transactions with information on processing steps, <a href="http://admin.utep.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=73859">click here</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3>How do electronic IAPs work?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Departments will submit an electronic IAP form for the transaction that they wish to complete. The form will route electronically for approvals. Once all approvals have been acquired, the party responsible for entering the transaction in PeopleSoft will receive an email notification that they can proceed to process in PeopleSoft.</p>
</div>
<h3>Who does the IAP approval email notification come from?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
It comes from the individual who initiated the IAP form.</p>
</div>
<h3>Which HR and Finance transactions require electronic IAP forms?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Budget transfer requests, new hire/rehires, position funding changes, position requests &amp; modifications, recruitment requests, travel authorizations, and vendor payments.</p>
</div>
<h3>How is the party responsible for entering the transaction in PeopleSoft going to know when they can begin to input data in PeopleSoft? </h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
They will receive an email notification to process the transaction in PeopleSoft.</p>
</div>
<h3>Who approves electronic IAP forms?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
For most common transactions, the account owner will approve the electronic IAP form. Depending on the transaction, specific central processing units (HR, Budget, Payroll, etc.) may also be in the approval routing.

</div>
<h3>Can electronic IAP forms be saved for later completion?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
No.</p>
</div>
<h3>When are transactions entered into PeopleSoft?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Transactions can be entered into PeopleSoft once all approvals have been collected. If your transaction required an electronic IAP form, you will receive a notification to enter your transaction into PeopleSoft. Your transaction will not be fully processed in PeopleSoft until all approvals have been collected outside of the system.</p>
</div>
<h3>Will electronic IAP forms have more than one approver per account authority (cost center)? </h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
No; there can only be one approver per account authority.</p>
</div>
<h3>What if the person responsible for approving an electronic IAP form is out of the office?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Approval for electronic forms are web-based. Approvers can approver anywhere with internet access. If they cannot approve for any reason, contact the Help Desk to reroute the IAP form. </p>
</div>
<h3>Can approvers see attachments on the electronic interim approval process forms?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Yes.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can the electronic IAP forms be returned?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Yes; return functionality is enabled. The system will prompt you to provide a justification.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can I request that someone approve electronic IAP forms on my behalf?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
Yes; please contact the Help Desk to have another employee approve electronic IAP forms on your behalf.</p>
</div>
<h3>If I have someone else setup as an approver on my behalf for electronic IAP forms, can I still approve the form?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
No; the original approver will not receive an FYA, and will lose the option to view and approve documents.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do IAP forms expire if not viewed?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
No.</p>
</div>
<h3>What if an IAP form is not approved?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong><br />
It is returned to the department initiator.</p>
