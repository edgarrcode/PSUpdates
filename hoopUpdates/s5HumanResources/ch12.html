<div class="subSection Level3">
	<h3>12.1.1 Purpose</h3>
	<p>The University of Texas at El Paso is committed to promoting a safe and secure environment. To that end, this policy sets forth requirements for criminal background checks. </p>
</div><!-- "subSection Level3" -->

<h2>12.2 Applicability</h2>

<p>This policy and requirements for criminal background checks applies to, at a minimum in the following situations:</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
	<p>	<b>12.2.1 Statutorily Required Criminal Background Check.</b>  Where State or federal law requires that a position/individual be subject to a criminal background check using a specific source of criminal background check information and/or certain procedures, the University will comply with such laws. To the extent such laws impose criminal background check requirements that are more extensive or substantially similar, the University may rely on compliance with the statute to satisfy the requirements of this policy. </p>

	<p>Similarly, the University may rely on the criminal background check conducted by an agency of the federal government to satisfy the requirements of this policy for an individual on assignment from an agency of the federal government, if the University receives documentation from that federal agency showing that a background check, including a criminal background check with a sex offender registry check, has been conducted by the federal agency.</p>

	<p><b>12.2.2 Applicants for Employment.</b>  A criminal background check will be conducted on any applicant, internal or external, who is under final consideration, following the normal screening and selection processes, for employment whether for a  full-time,  part-time, regular, temporary or student  position of employment with the University.  The University may rely on a criminal background check conducted at the University within the past twelve (12) months if there is not a break in service of more than six (6) months and the criminal background check relied on is appropriate for the position sought. The authorization form may be found on the Human Resources website under the HR Forms section. </p>
	<p>The University will obtain an authorization form signed by the applicant before the University requests the check.  The form must conform to applicable State and Federal law.</p>

	<p><b>12.5.4</b> No Automatic Disqualification. Except as outlined in section 12.5.4.1 below, the University does not automatically disqualify all applicants or current employees with a criminal background from employment or continued employment, appointment or privileges. In the event the investigation reveals a criminal background, the hiring official and/or the divisional Vice President when a current employee, must consult with the Office of Human Resources in these circumstances and determine, on a case by case basis, whether the individual is qualified based on factors such as:</p>
