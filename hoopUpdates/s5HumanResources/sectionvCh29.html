<h2>29.1. Policy</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>29.1.1</strong>  Applicability.  This policy applies to all University employees. (UTS 180, Sec. 1)</p>
<p><strong>29.1.2</strong>  Purpose. This policy is intended to protect the credibility and reputation of the U.T. System, the University of Texas at El Paso (University) and of members of the faculty and staff by providing a transparent system of disclosure, approval, and documentation of employee activities outside the U. T. System and the University that might otherwise raise concerns about conflicts of interest or conflicts of commitment. The policy also serves the purpose of ensuring compliance with State ethics laws and Regents’ Rules.  Finally, the policy is intended to provide the framework for rules and procedures that will clearly delineate permissible outside activities. (UTS 180, Sec. 2)</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p><strong>29.2</strong> Primary Responsibility.  The primary responsibility of employees of the University is the accomplishment of the duties and responsibilities assigned to one’s position of appointment. (Regents’ Rule 30104, Sec. 1; UTS 180, Sec. 3)</p>
<hr />
<h2>29.3 Outside Activities.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Regents’ Rule 30104 permits University employees to engage in outside work or activity, so long as the work or activity complies with the requirements of the Rule and does not violate State laws or U. T. System or University rules or policies governing the conduct of employees, including ethics standards and provisions prohibiting conflicts of interest, conflicts of commitment, and the use of State resources. (Regents’ Rule 30104, Sec. 2; UTS 180, Sec. 4)</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>29.4 Conflicts of Interest and Conflicts of Commitment Prohibited.</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>29.4.1</strong>  University employees may not have a direct or indirect interest, including financial and other interests, or engage in a business transaction (i.e. self-dealing) or professional activity, or incur any obligation of any nature that is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of the employee’s duties for the University. (Regents’ Rule 30104, Sec. 3; UTS 180, Sec. 5)</p>
<p><strong>29.4.2</strong>  Activities on behalf of outside entities or individuals must not interfere with a University employee’s fulfillment of his/her duties and responsibilities to the University. Such conflicts of commitment may arise regardless of the location of these activities (on or off campus), the type of outside entity (individual, for-profit, not-for-profit, or government), or the level of compensation (compensated or non-compensated.) (Regents’ Rule 30104, Sec. 4; UTS 180, Sec. 5)</p>

<h2>29.6 Guidelines for reviewing and approving requests to engage in outside activity.</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>29.6.1</strong>  Approval Authorities. The President shall designate the individuals who will have the approval authority under this policy. </p>
<h3>29.6.2  Faculty Time</h3>
<p>Members of the faculty have flexibility in using their time to prepare for teaching and engage in research and other scholarly activity. Other responsibilities, such as presenting lectures, being available to meet with students, and participating in university committees, have more rigid time demands. During the academic term in which a faculty member holds a full-time appointment, the faculty member must attend to all their duties and other responsibilities and meet the minimum academic workload requirements. Additionally, during the academic term in which a faculty member holds a full-time appointment, faculty may be permitted to engage in an average of 8 hours of approved outside activity each week during the term of an appointment. Under no circumstances may the outside activity exceed an average of 8 hours a week during the term of appointment without explicit approval of the President and a written management plan.</p>
<h3>29.6.3  Categories of Outside Faculty Activity</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Some activity is so integral to the mission of the University that it is encouraged and may be performed on university time (as defined in 29.16 below), and may be considered pre-approved, so long as the activity does not reasonably appear to create a conflict of interest and the amount of time committed does not interfere with faculty member’s University duties and responsibilities. This may include activities such as the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Serving on a federal, state, or local government agency committee, panel, or commission.</li>
        <li>Acting in an editorial capacity for a professional journal.</li>
        <li>Reviewing journal manuscripts, book manuscripts, or grant or contract proposals.</li>
        <li>Attending and presenting talks at scholarly colloquia and conferences.</li>
        <li>Developing scholarly communications in the form of books or journal articles, movies, television productions, and similar works, even when such activities result in financial gain, consistent with intellectual property and other applicable U. T. System and institution policies and guidelines.</li>
        <li>Serving as a committee member or as an officer of a professional or scholarly society.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A category of outside faculty activity that, when disclosed and approved, is permitted, can be encouraged, and may be performed during the university time permitted under Sec. 29.6.2, above includes:
    <div class="subSection Level4">
    <p>Engaging in professional activity such as providing expert testimony, providing consulting services, professional/clinical practice, and serving on a board of directors, but only when such activity clearly contributes to the mission of the University or provides important elements of faculty professional development related to the faculty member’s University duties and responsibilities, and the activity does not reasonably appear to create a conflict of interest and does not interfere with the faculty member’s University duties and responsibilities.</p>
    </div>
    <!-- Level4 -->    </li>
    <li>Faculty members may also engage in activity that does not necessarily contribute to the mission of University or provide elements of faculty professional development related to their University duties and responsibilities, so long as it does not reasonably appear to create a conflict of interest or interfere with the faculty member’s University duties and responsibilities. Any such activity must take place only on non-University time, without use of University resources, and is disclosed and approved as required by this policy.</li>
</ol>
<h3>29.6.4  Accounting for Outside Board Service</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Uncompensated Outside Board Service of Direct Benefit to U.T., other than scholarly boards pre-approved under Sec. 29.5(c), above.</span>  Regents’ Rule 30104 recognizes the benefit to be derived by U.T. institutions from outside board service. After thorough consideration of the time commitment, certain service on outside boards may be deemed to be of sufficient benefit to the University that certain service may be performed on university time.  The service:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>must be service on a nonreligious board;</li>
        <li>must be uncompensated (other than for reimbursement of usual and customary expenses);  </li>
        <li>requires prior approval; and</li>
        <li>requires disclosure.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compensated Board Service or Service to a Religious Organization.</span> Service on an outside board for which the employee is compensated, and any service to a religious organization whether or not compensated, must be on the person’s own time.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>If the service occurs during normal office hours, the person must use vacation time, compensatory time, or other appropriate leave while providing the service. </li>
        <li>The service must be without cost to U.T. System or the University.</li>
        <li>Service to a local religious congregation that is primarily personal does not require prior approval and does not need to be disclosed, regardless of compensation.  Service on the board of a religious organization that provides services that the employee’s U.T. institution provides, such as a religious hospital or academic institution, requires prior approval and must be disclosed.</li>
        <li>Compensated service on a nonreligious board requires prior approval and must be disclosed, except as noted at (c), below. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Board Service or Activity that is Personal.</span> Participation (regardless of compensation) on outside boards or activity in which the service is primarily personal rather than professional in nature and is done on one’s own time is permitted without the requirement of approval or disclosure if it does not create a conflict of interest or conflict of commitment or the appearance of a conflict of interest or conflict of commitment.  Examples include boards of the following nature—a municipality; local religious congregation; neighborhood association; public, private or parochial school; political organization; social advocacy organization; youth sports or recreation league; affinity group such as the local orchid society or model train collectors club; and other similar outside boards.</li>
</ol>
<h3>29.6.5  Management Plans.</h3>
<p>Management plans must be in place for all faculty, administrative and professional staff, and certain classified staff for outside activities that may create a conflict of interest or a conflict of commitment before activity begins. The President shall designate an official(s) to develop and approve management plans to be developed under this policy.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<p><strong>29.7</strong>    Appeals. Individuals whose request for approval of outside activity is denied may request that the denying authority reconsider the decision and provide an explanation in writing. If the individual remains unsatisfied with the decision, he or she may access standard grievance procedures to the extent that they are otherwise applicable.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>29.8</strong>    Prospective and Retrospective Approval. In rare instance, outside activity may be approved retrospectively when the individual is called upon to assist in an emergency or urgent situation where it would be impossible or unreasonable to obtain advance approval. In such cases, the activity must be fully disclosed and approval sought from the appropriate authority as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>29.8.1</strong>  Some activity may also be prospectively approved, for up to one year, when an individual describes to the approving authority as fully as reasonably possible the general nature and extent of anticipated, but not confirmed, outside opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>29.8.2</strong>  In any event, whether previously approved or not, employees should ensure they notify their chair, dean, or supervisor in advance when they will be missing specific responsibilities.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<p><strong>29.9</strong> Confidential Outside Activity. If an individual wishes to engage in an activity for which some or all of the relevant information is confidential, the approving authority may nonetheless approve the activity without requiring full written disclosure upon satisfaction that there is a compelling reason to treat the information confidentially and the activity is otherwise fully compliant with this policy and all other applicable laws and University and U. T. System policies.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>29.10</strong> Rescinding Approvals. An approving authority may rescind an approved outside activity upon receipt of information indicating that the activity is not consistent with this policy or any applicable law or University or U. T. System policy. The individual for whom the activity may be rescinded shall be given notice of the information and an opportunity to respond.</p>
<hr />
<h2>29.11   Electronic Database.</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Disclosure of outside activity, documentation of requests for approval, and subsequent approvals shall be maintained for all full-time faculty and full-time administrative and professional staff in an electronic database that will include the following elements:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>a description of the nature and extent of all outside employment or other compensated activity and of all outside activity, regardless of compensation level, that reasonably appears to create a conflict of interest or a conflict of commitment; </li>

        <li>a description of gifts over $250 to the individual, but only if the gift reasonably appears to create a conflict of interest, and it is not a gift from one’s spouse, parent, child, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild; or from the spouse of a parent, child, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild; or from the parent, child, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild of one’s spouse; and</li>
        <li>for part-time members of the faculty and part-time members of the administrative and professional staff, a description or the nature and extent of any outside activity and any substantial interest in a  business entity that reasonably appears to create a conflict of interest.</li>

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">

        <li>all information disclosed by the Chancellor, U.T. System Executive Officers, and Presidents, and</li>
        <li>instructions for gaining access  to a copy of any conflict management plan, except for any confidential information protected pursuant to Sec.29.9 above.</li>
        <li>Information regarding family members will not be posted publically.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>29.12</strong>   Gifts. When the University accepts a gift, grant, donation, or other consideration from a person that the person designates to be used as a salary supplement for an employee of the institution, the receiving entity shall analyze the gift, grant or donation for potential conflicts of interest. If a conflict of interest exists, the institution shall utilize its current processes and procedures to eliminate or manage the conflict.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>29.13</strong>   Noncompliance. Noncompliance with this policy may subject one to discipline in accord with applicable procedures up to and including termination of employment.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>29.14</strong>   Use of University Property. University property may only be used for State purposes appropriate to University’s mission.
