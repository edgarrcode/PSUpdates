<h2>7.1 General Provisions</h2>
<p>The University provides a University identification card to each student for University identification and administrative purposes, and the card remains the property of the University. Students are expected to have their ID cards in their possession at all times while on the campus and to maintain proper and reasonable care for the card. Students may be asked to produce the ID card and/or to identify themselves at any time by a faculty member or a University official acting in the course of his/her duties. Refusal to identify himself/herself will subject a student to disciplinary action. Failure to produce the ID card as requested will result in denial of University services or activities to which the student is otherwise entitled. Only currently validated ID cards in good condition will be accepted for University purposes.</p>

<div class="subSection Level3">
<h3>7.2.1 Issuance, Care, and Replacement</h3>
<p>A University ID card is issued to each new student who enrolls at the University, and it is the student's responsibility to claim his/her card within six weeks from the initial enrollment. Students are expected to provide proper and reasonable care for the card and not subject the card to abuse or improper treatment, such as exposure to excessive heat or pressure. Students are responsible for replacing damaged, altered, or lost cards and an appropriate fee is charged for claiming an initial card late, or replacing a damaged, altered or lost card. A card is considered damaged when it has lost its shape or when the name, student number, or photo is damaged. Upon graduation or non-re-enrollment, students are required to return the University ID card when the general property deposit is claimed. Such students returning within five years are charged a replacement fee in order to receive a new ID card.</p>
<h3>7.2.2 Violations </h3>
<p>Only one ID card is permitted for each student, and a student having more than one card must return the extra card(s) to the Office of the Registrar with no refund. A student may not alter or change anything on the ID card without approval of the Office of the Registrar. </p>
<p>Only the student to whom the ID card is issued may use the card and the services and privileges to which the enrolled student is entitled. An ID card may not be loaned and used by anyone other than the student to whom the card is issued. Violations including altering of the card, possession and use of more than one card, and/or use of the card by anyone other than the student to whom the card is issued will subject the student(s) to disciplinary action.</p>
