<h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The Rules and Regulations governing information/computing policies for the University of Texas at El Paso are intended to supplement existing policies published by the Texas Department of Information Resources, the University of Texas System, as well as reinforcing the Texas Computer Crimes Law and laws governing the use or misuse of state property.</p>
<p>It is imperative that all users of the University's information/computing and information resources realize how much these resources require responsible behavior from all users. We are all responsible for the well-being of the information/computing, network, and information resources we use. It is the intent of these policies and procedures to provide general guidance in the proper use of these resources for optimal use.</p>
<p>We acknowledge our commitment to promote the open exchange of ideas; however, an open, cooperative information/computing network can be vulnerable to abuse or misuse. As more and more schools, colleges, universities, businesses, government agencies, and other enterprises become attached to the world-wide information/computing and information networks, it is critical that we ensure that our students, faculty, and staff are well aware of our individual and institutional responsibilities in the use of state resources.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1.2 Purpose </h2>
<p>The University of Texas at El Paso recognizes University information/computing resources as valuable state assets and will manage these resources accordingly. Information/computing resources include all computer and telecommunication hardware, software, and networks owned, leased, or operated by the University, and the data or information stored therein. The following policies establish the governing philosophy for the use of these resources by students, faculty, staff, and other specifically authorized individuals or entities, to ensure compliance with State laws and regulations regarding the use and security of University information/computing resources, and to provide the maximum benefit of these resources to the University community.</p>
<p>These policies augment and incorporate by reference the following:</p>
<p>The University of Texas System Policy (UTS) 165 â€“ Information Resources Use and Security Policy</p>
<p>The Texas Department of Information Resource, Information Security Standards. (Texas Administrative Code, 1TAC202)</p>
<p>The Information Resources Management Act. (Texas Government Code, Section 2054.001 et seq.)</p>
<p>The Texas Computer Crime Statute (Texas Penal Code, Section 33.02).</p>
<p>All use of University information/computing resources must comply with applicable Federal and State laws as well as U. T. System and University regulations as they relate to the proper use of State property; the observance of intellectual property rights; the protection of information and computing resources from damage, disruption, or misuse; and requirements concerning content. All users, whether student, employee, or other authorized individuals, are required to be aware of, abide by, and enforce the provisions of these policies.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1.3 Statement of General Policy</h2>
<p>In support of its mission of teaching, research, and public service, the University of Texas at El Paso provides access to information/computing resources for students, faculty, and staff, to the extent permitted by the financial resources of the University as reflected within established institutional priorities.</p>
<p>The access granted students, faculty and staff to the University's information/ computing resources is a privilege, not a right. The University may limit, restrict, deny or extend access to its information/computing resources in any manner that may be required to protect information held confidential by law, to protect the integrity of the contents of data files and to provide for orderly and efficient use of information/computing resources.</p>
<p>Authorized users of University Information/Computing resources are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>University students who are limited to the use of those information/computing resources specifically assigned to serve educational purposes.</li>
    <li>University employees who are provided access to those information/computing resources required for the performance of their duties in the conduct of official business. Access to any particular administrative data file must be based on an employee's "need to know" as established by his or her official duties and reflected in the advance provision of specific authorization codes, passwords or other access enabling means to the employee.</li>
    <li>Non-University affiliated individuals or entities may not use University information/computing resources except after written agreement for purposes related to the University's missions.</li>
</ol>
<p>All users of University-owned, leased or controlled information/computing systems must act responsibly, respect the rights of other users, protect the physical facilities and equipment, and observe all pertinent license and contractual agreements affecting the use of systems, hardware or software.</p>
<p>Information/computing facilities and accounts are to be used only for University-related activities by the person to whom they are assigned. The University's information/computing resources may not be used for the conduct, advertisement, promotion, or any form of solicitation, on behalf of any non-University operated business, corporation, organization, enterprise or activity, whether profit or non-profit in nature, nor may University resources be used by individuals for personal benefit or private gain, including the conduct of consulting services by faculty or staff.</p>
<p>Because all files created or maintained using the University's information/computing resources are property of the University; it must be understood that the University can convey no expectation of privacy or confidentiality to a user. While general access to specific files can be limited or controlled where appropriate for legitimate business reasons, authorized University officials can enter and examine the contents of all files maintained on university-owned equipment or information resources connected to University owned information resources. All user files are further subject to external review and possible public release resulting from a search warrant or subpoena issued and served pursuant to law, or a valid request under the Texas Public Information Act.</p>
<hr />
<h2>1.4 Internet Access and Use</h2>
<p>The University of Texas at El Paso recognizes the value and potential of information published on the Internet and encourages all faculty, staff, and students to develop innovative uses of web technologies in pursuit of the University's mission. To achieve this purpose, the University owns and operates servers to facilitate the educational process and enhance research and publication by University faculty, staff and students.</p>
<p>Because the University recognizes the value of the Internet as a resource for information and communication, students and employees may make incidental use of University resources to access the web for co-curricular or personal purposes provided they abide by the general policies and procedures governing use of information/computing resources and there is no direct cost to the University attributable to such incidental use.</p>
