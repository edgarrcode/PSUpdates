<h2>5.1 Inclement Weather Conditions</h2>
<p>Any decision to close The University of Texas at El Paso during severe weather will be made after several factors are considered, including current and forecasted weather conditions, street conditions and any decision made by the major public school districts to cancel classes. Information concerning weather, road conditions and the status of the University campus physical facilities will be gathered by the Vice President for Business Affairs and transmitted to the President.</p>
<p>The President shall make the decision to close the University due to inclement weather. In the absence of the President, the decision to close University offices and suspend classes will be made by the Vice President for Business Affairs.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5.2 Notification </h2>
<p>If a decision is made by the President to close the University, the Provost, the Vice President for Student Affairs, the Vice President for Institutional Advancement, the Vice President for Research and Sponsored Projects, University Communications Office, and the University Police will be notified immediately by the Vice President for Business Affairs. The Vice Presidents will assume responsibility for notifying key supervisory personnel in their respective divisions.</p>
<p>The Director of University Communications will notify all local news media. Every effort will be made to notify area television and radio stations no later than 6:00 a.m. if the University is to be closed for all or part of the day.</p>
<p>Inquiries regarding closure of the University during periods of extreme weather should be directed to the University Police department or University Communications.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5.3 Closing of the University</h2>
<p>A decision to close the University will result in suspension of all classes and closure of most offices. During such times, students, faculty, and staff, will not be expected to perform their normal work assignments. The following offices, however, will remain open to provide essential services:</p>
<ul>
    <li>University Police</li>
    <li>Telecommunications</li>
    <li>U.S. Post Office-Union</li>
    <li>Student Housing</li>
</ul>
<p>Other essential services determined by each Vice President</p>
<p>Employees who are required to work when the University is closed because of inclement weather will, if eligible, earn equivalent compensatory time for the hours they work.</p>
<hr />
<h2>5.4 Absence During Inclement Weather</h2>
<p>During periods of severe weather members of the faculty or staff who cannot travel safely are expected to notify their Department Chair or Director by phone unless there has been an official announcement that the University has been closed. When the University is open, all faculty and staff members are expected to make a reasonable effort to meet their assigned responsibilities. Hours of work missed by staff members, while the University is open, must be charged to vacation leave or earned compensatory time, or leave without pay, if no vacation leave or compensatory time is available. (Minor periods of tardiness will be excused. However, lengthy periods should either be made up in the same work week or charged to annual leave, or leave without pay, as appropriate.)</p>
<p>Absences by faculty members will be handled in accordance with current academic policies.</p>
