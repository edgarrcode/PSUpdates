<h2>3.1 Vehicle Fleet Management Plan</h2>
<p>House Bill 3125, 76th Legislature, mandates the Office of Vehicle Fleet Management (OVFM) of the General Services Commission (GSC), as directed by the State Council on Competitive Government (CCG), to develop a management plan for the state's fleet. This plan is to provide detailed recommendations for improving administration and operation of the state's vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>The State Vehicle Fleet Management Plan (the plan) addresses state agencies to include institutions of higher education and provides additional direction to implement the provisions of the bill. UTEP will strive comply with provisions of HB 3125.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3.2 Vehicle Assignment and Use</h2>
<p>Motor vehicles owned by the University will be used solely for official business. Official business is defined as use that supports and provides a direct benefit to this University.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motor Pool</span> - The University maintains a portion of its fleet in a Motor Pool for use by University faculty/staff on official University business.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vehicle / Field Assignment</span> - Vehicles purchased with state appropriated funds, may be assigned to field employees providing specific criteria is met. The vehicle must be utilized to serve a mission critical function for an approved activity. Annual utilization must meet the minimum use criteria established by the "The Plan". UTEP does not assign vehicles to individual Administrative or Executive employees.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Vehicle / Departmental Assignment</span> - Vehicles purchased with state funds and assigned to service departments on a permanent basis, must meet mission critical and specific use criteria. Departmental assigned vehicles are generally assigned to provide on campus service needs, i.e. (plant maintenance, grounds, electric, plumbing, carpentry, paint, mail service, etc.)</p>
<hr />
<h2>3.3 Vehicle Replacement</h2>
<p>The guidelines adapted by the University provide minimum replacement goals for routine vehicle replacement. Attainment of these goals should minimize fleet capital and operating costs. In general, most vehicles should be replaced when they reach 6 years (72 months) of service or 100,000 miles, whichever comes first. However, there may be circumstances in which vehicles may be replaced sooner (such as excessive maintenance or repair costs) or retained longer (such as unusually low maintenance costs). We will utilize the table in HB-3125 that details replacement goals for different types of vehicles and vehicle uses as a guide for vehicle replacement recommendations.</p>
<p>Specialized equipment, such as heavy construction equipment, may not fall under any of the above categories. Such equipment may be considered for replacement according to other criteria, such as hours in service.</p>
<hr />
<h2>3.4 Fleet Fueling Policy</h2>
<p>The University utilizes the statewide contract with Voyager for retail fuel dispensing services. Fuel cards are issued to specific vehicles. The Physical Plant maintains two regular unleaded fuel pumps and one diesel fuel pump on campus. Unless specifically prohibited by manufacturer warranty or recommendations, all state vehicles operating on gasoline shall use regular unleaded gasoline.</p>
