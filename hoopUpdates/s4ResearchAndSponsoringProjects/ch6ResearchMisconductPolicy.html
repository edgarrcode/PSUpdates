<hr />
<h2>6.2 Definitions</h2>
<p>Throughout Section IV, Research and Sponsored Projects, Chapter 6, Research Misconduct Policy, of this Handbook, unless the context requires a different meaning:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>"Allegation": Any written or oral statement or other indication of possible research misconduct made to a University official. </li>
    <li>"Complainant": A person who makes an allegation of research misconduct. </li>
    <li>"Conflict of Interest": The real or apparent interference of one person's interests with the interests of another person, where potential bias may occur due to prior or existing personal or professional relationships.</li>
    <li>"Deciding Official": The Vice President for Research is the deciding official who makes final determinations on allegations of research misconduct and any responsive University actions. </li>
    <li>"Employee": Any person paid by, under the control of, or affiliated with the University, including but not limited to faculty, trainees, students, fellows, technicians, nurses, support staff, and guest researchers.</li>

    <li>"Fabrication": Making up data or results and recording or reporting them. </li>
    <li>"Falsification": Manipulating research materials, equipment, or processes, or changing or omitting data or results such that the research is not accurately represented in the research record. </li>
    <li>"Good Faith Allegation": An allegation made with the honest belief that research misconduct may have occurred.  An allegation is not in good faith if it is made with reckless disregard for or willful ignorance of facts that would disprove the allegation.</li>
    <li>"Inquiry": Preliminary information-gathering and fact-finding to determine whether an allegation or apparent instance of research misconduct warrants an investigation. </li>
    <li>"Investigation": The formal development of a factual record and examination and evaluation of all relevant facts to determine if research misconduct has occurred and, if so, to determine the responsible person and the seriousness of the misconduct.</li>
    <li>"ORI": The Office of Research Integrity, the office within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that is responsible for the research misconduct and research integrity activities of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS).</li>
    <li>"PHS Regulation": The Public Health Service (PHS) regulation establishing standards for institutional inquiries and investigations into allegations of research misconduct, which is set forth at 42 CFR Part 93, entitled "Public Health Service Policies on Research Misconduct".</li>
    <li>"Plagiarism": The appropriation of another person's ideas, processes, results, or words without giving appropriate credit. </li>
    <li>"Preponderance of the evidence": proof by information that compared with that opposing it, leads to the conclusion that the fact issue is more probably true than not. </li>
    <li>"Relevant Governmental Agencies": Federal and/or state agencies providing financial support for the University research activities which are governed by research misconduct regulations (e.g. NSF, NIH, etc).</li>
    <li>"Research Integrity Officer (RIO)": The University official designated by the Vice President for Research with responsibilities related to administrative handling of allegations of research misconduct</li>
    <li>"Research Misconduct": Fabrication, falsification, plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting results.  Research misconduct does not include honest error or differences of opinion.  To constitute research misconduct, the behavior must (1) represent a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community; and (2) be committed intentionally, knowingly, or with reckless disregard for the integrity of the research; and, (3) the allegation is proven by the preponderance of evidence.  [Federal Register: September 1, 2005 (Volume 70, Number 169)].</li>
    <li>"Research Record": Any data, document, computer file, computer diskette, electronic information storage device, or any other written or non-written account or object that reasonably may be expected to provide evidence or information regarding the proposed, conducted, or reported research that constitutes the subject of an allegation of research misconduct.

    <li>"Retaliation": Any action that adversely affects the employment or other status of an individual that is taken by the University, an institution or an employee because the individual has, in good faith, made an allegation of research misconduct or of inadequate University response thereto, or has cooperated in good faith with an investigation of such allegation.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>6.3 Evidentiary Standards</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.3.1</strong> The following evidentiary standards apply to findings:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Standard of proof.  A University finding of research misconduct must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. </li>
    <li>Burden of proof.
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>The University has the burden of proof for making a finding of research misconduct.  The destruction, absence of, or respondent's failure to provide research records adequately documenting the questioned research is evidence of research misconduct where the University establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the respondent intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly had research records and destroyed them, had the opportunity to maintain the records but did not do so, or maintained the records and failed to produce them in a timely manner and that the respondent's conduct constitutes a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community.</li>
        <li>The respondent has the burden of going forward with and the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any and all affirmative defenses raised.  In determining whether the University has carried the burden of proof imposed by this section, the finder of fact shall give due consideration to admissible, credible evidence of honest error or difference of opinion presented by the respondent.</li>
        <li>The respondent has the burden of going forward with and proving by a preponderance of the evidence any mitigating factors that are relevant to a decision to impose administrative actions following a research misconduct proceeding.</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.4 Reporting</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.4.1</strong> Allegations of research misconduct should be placed in writing and brought to the attention of the Vice President for Research.  The Vice President for Research will bring such allegations to the attention of the appropriate Dean, department Chair, principal investigator of the research program and any researchers affected by the allegations.  The Vice President for Research, with due regard for the reputations of all parties involved, including those who in good faith reported the apparent misconduct, will immediately conduct an assessment of the allegations.</p>
<p><strong>6.4.2</strong> When the University's review of the allegation identifies non-research misconduct issues, the Vice President for Research should refer these matters to the proper University or Federal office for action.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.5 Responding to Allegations</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.5.1</strong> In responding to allegations of research misconduct, the Vice President for Research will make diligent efforts to ensure that the following functions are performed:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Any allegation assessment, inquiry, or investigation is conducted in a timely, objective, thorough, and competent manner. </li>
    <li>Reasonable precautions are taken to avoid bias and real or apparent conflicts of interest on the part of those involved in conducting the inquiry or investigation. </li>
    <li>Immediate notification is provided to ORI or other relevant governmental agency if:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
        <li>there is an immediate health hazard involved; </li>
        <li>there is an immediate need to protect Federal funds or equipment; </li>
        <li>there is an immediate need to protect the interests of the person(s) making the allegations or of the individual(s) who is the subject of the allegations, as well as his/her co-investigators and associates, if any;</li>
        <li>it is probable that the alleged incident is going to be reported publicly; </li>
        <li>the allegation involves a public health sensitive issue, e.g., a clinical trial; or, </li>
        <li>there is a reasonable indication of a possible Federal criminal violation.  In this instance, the University must inform ORI and/or any other relevant governmental agency within 24 hours of obtaining that information. </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Interim administrative actions are taken, as appropriate, to protect Federal funds and the public health, and to ensure that the purposes of the Federal financial assistance are carried out.    </li>
</ol>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.6 Preliminary Assessment into Allegations</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.6.1</strong> Upon receiving an allegation of research misconduct, the Vice President for Research will immediately assess the allegation to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant an inquiry, whether PHS support or applications for funding or other relevant governmental agencies are involved, and whether the allegation falls under the definition of research misconduct.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.7 Conducting the Inquiry</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.7.1</strong> Following the preliminary assessment, if the Vice President for Research determines that the allegation provides sufficient information to allow specific follow-up, and falls under the definition of research misconduct, the Vice President for Research will notify and review the preliminary assessment with the Provost.  With concurrence from the Provost, the Vice President for Research and the RIO will immediately initiate the inquiry process.  In initiating the inquiry, the Vice President for Research and/or the RIO should identify clearly the original allegation and any related issues that should be evaluated.  The purpose of the inquiry is to make a preliminary evaluation of the available evidence and testimony of the respondent, complainant, and key witnesses to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of possible research misconduct to warrant an investigation.  The purpose of the inquiry is not to reach a final conclusion about whether misconduct definitely occurred or who was responsible.  The findings of the inquiry must be set forth in an inquiry report.</p>
<p><strong>6.7.2</strong> The Vice President for Research will determine whether any University affiliated organization/institution is also involved in the research thus possibly warranting a joint inquiry.  If so, the appropriate affiliated organizational or institutional official should be contacted.  Factors to be considered in the decision to conduct a joint inquiry would include source of pay for the investigator, presence or absence of joint appointment, presence or absence of "Without Pay" (WOC) appointments at organizations, source of funding for the research, site where the research was conducted, subject population involved, etc.  After consideration and discussion of these factors, the decision on whether a joint investigation is indicated would be made.  If a joint investigation is warranted, a decision on which organization has the lead should be made.  In most other scenarios with other affiliated organizations, the University would be the lead organization.</p>
<p><strong>6.7.3</strong> As soon as practical after the Vice President for Research determines that an inquiry is required, the Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Secure the relevant research records; </li>
    <li>Notify the President, the Provost, the Office of Legal Affairs, and the respondent; </li>
    <li>Appoint a person or persons to conduct an initial inquiry; and, </li>
    <li>Notify ORI if PHS support is involved, and other relevant governmental agencies, if any of the conditions listed above under section 6.5.1 (c) exist. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6.7.4</strong> The Vice President for Research may consult with ORI or other relevant governmental agencies at any time regarding appropriate procedures to be followed.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.8 Notification of the Respondent</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.8.1</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will notify the respondent in writing of the opening of the inquiry, or this notification may be sent simultaneously with sequestering of records.  See "Sequestration of Research Records" below.</p>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>6.8.1.1</strong> The notification should identify the research project in question and the specific allegations; define research misconduct; identify the funding involved; list the name or names of the person or persons conducting the initial inquiry and expert consultants (if any); explain the respondent's opportunity to challenge the person or persons designated for bias or conflict of interest, to be assisted by legal counsel, to be interviewed, to present evidence to the person or persons designated, and to comment on the inquiry report; address the respondent's obligation as an employee of the University to cooperate; and, describe the University's policy on protecting the complainant against retaliation and the need to maintain the complainant's confidentiality during the inquiry and any subsequent proceedings.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 --></div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.9 Potential Respondents</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.9.1</strong> If no specific respondent has been identified at this stage of the process, the Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will notify each potential respondent that an inquiry will be undertaken, e.g., each co-author on a questioned article or each investigator on a questioned grant application.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.10 Sequestration of Research Records</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.10.1</strong> To the extent it has not already been done at the allegation stage, the University must, on or before the date on which the respondent is notified or the inquiry begins, whichever is earlier, promptly take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all research records and evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct proceeding, inventory the records and evidence, and sequester them in a secure manner.  Where the research records or evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a number or users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence on such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent to the evidentiary value of the instruments.</p>
<p><strong>6.10.2</strong> Research records produced under grants and cooperative agreements are the property of the University, and employees cannot interfere with the University's right of access to them.  Under contracts, certain research records may belong to PHS or another funding agency, but the University will be provided access to contract records in the custody of the University for purposes of reviewing misconduct allegations.</p>
<p><strong>6.10.3</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the Rio should notify the respondent that an inquiry is being initiated simultaneously with the sequestration so that the respondent can assist with location and identification of the research records.  The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO should obtain the assistance of the respondent's supervisor and legal counsel in this process, as necessary.  If the respondent is not available, sequestration may begin in the respondent's absence.  The respondent should not be notified in advance of the sequestration of research records to prevent questions being raised later regarding missing documents or materials and to prevent accusations against the respondent of tampering with or fabricating data or materials after the notification.  In addition to securing records under the control of the respondent, the Vice President for Research and/or the RIO may need to sequester records from other individuals, such as co-authors, collaborators, or complainants.  A copy of each sequestered record will be provided to the individual from whom the record is taken within as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>6.10.3.1</strong> A dated receipt should be signed by the sequestering official and the person from whom an item is collected, and a copy of the receipt should be given to the person from whom the record is taken.  If it is not possible to prepare a complete inventory list at the time of collection, one should be prepared as soon as possible, and then a copy should be given to the person from whom the items were collected.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<p><strong>6.10.4</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will lock records and materials in a secure place.  The persons from whom items are collected may be provided with a copy of any item.  Where feasible, that person will have access to his or her own original items under the direct and continuous supervision of a University official.  This will ensure that a proper chain of custody is maintained and that the originals are kept intact and unmodified.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.11 Designation of an Official or a Committee to Conduct the Inquiry</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.11.1</strong> The Vice President for Research is responsible for conducting or designating others to conduct the inquiry.  The person or persons designated to conduct the inquiry will obtain the necessary expert and technical advice to consider properly all research issues.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.12 Inquiry</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.12.1</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will take reasonable steps to ensure that those conducting the inquiry and any expert consultants have no bias or personal or professional conflict of interest with the respondent, complainant, or the case in question.  In making this determination, the Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will consider whether the individual (or any members of his or her immediate family):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Has any financial involvement with the respondent or complainant; </li>
    <li>Has been a co-author on a publication with the respondent or complainant; </li>
    <li>Has been a collaborator or co-investigator with the respondent or complainant; </li>
    <li>Has been a party to a scientific controversy with the respondent or complainant; </li>
    <li>Has a supervisory or mentor relationship with the respondent or complainant; </li>
    <li>Has a special relationship, such as a close personal friendship, kinship, or a physician/patient relationship with the respondent or complainant; or, </li>
    <li>Falls within any other circumstance that might appear to compromise the individual's objectivity in reviewing the allegations. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6.12.2</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will notify the respondent of the proposed person or persons to conduct the inquiry within ten (10) business days. If the respondent submits a written objection to anyone appointed based on bias or conflict of interest within five (5) business days, the Vice President for Research will immediately determine whether to replace the challenged member or expert with a qualified substitute.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.3</strong> The person or persons conducting the inquiry and any expert consultants will agree in writing to observe the confidentiality of the proceeding and any information or documents reviewed as part of the inquiry. Outside of the official proceedings of the inquiry they may not discuss the proceedings with the respondent, complainant, witnesses, or anyone not authorized by the Vice President for Research to have knowledge of the inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.4</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO Office, in consultation with the legal counsel, will provide staff assistance and guidance to the person or persons conducting the inquiry and the experts on the procedures for conducting and completing the inquiry, including procedures for maintaining confidentiality, conducting interviews, analyzing data, and preparing the inquiry report.</p>
<h3>6.12.5 Charge</h3>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>6.12.5.1</strong> The Vice President for Research will prepare a charge for the person or persons conducting the inquiry that describes the allegations and any related issues identified during the allegation assessment and states that the purpose of the inquiry is to make a preliminary evaluation of the evidence and testimony of the respondent, complainant, and key witnesses to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of possible research misconduct to warrant an investigation. The purpose is not to determine whether research misconduct definitely occurred or who was responsible.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.5.2</strong> The Vice President for Research and legal counsel are available throughout the inquiry to advise those conducting the inquiry as needed.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<h3>6.12.6 General Approaches to Conducting the Inquiry</h3>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>6.12.6.1</strong> All necessary steps must be taken to avoid bias or conflict of interest between those conducting the inquiry and expert consultants and the respondent, and complainant.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.6.2</strong> The Vice President for Research and the RIO must be advised of any necessary interim actions to protect the research funds, human or animal subjects, or other steps required by regulation or policy.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<h3>6.12.7 General Approach to Conducting an Interview</h3>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>6.12.7.1</strong> Interviews with the respondent will be transcribed or recorded. Interviews with anyone else will be recorded. A transcript or summary of the interview will be provided to each witness for review and correction of errors. Witnesses may add comments or information. Changes to the transcript or summary will be made only to correct factual errors.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>6.12.7.1.1</strong> Witnesses should be advised that the proceedings are confidential and that they should not discuss the inquiry or their interview with anyone else other than their counsel or adviser.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.7.1.2</strong> Witnesses may be accompanied and advised by legal counsel or by a non-legal adviser who is not a principal or witness in the case. However, the counsel or adviser may only advise the witness and may not participate directly in the interview. Witnesses will respond directly to the interview questions.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<p><strong>6.12.7.2</strong> If the respondent admits to the misconduct, the respondent should be asked immediately to sign a statement attesting to the occurrence and extent of the misconduct. Normally, an admission is a sufficient basis to proceed directly to an investigation. However, the admission may not be a sufficient basis for closing a case. Further investigation may be needed to determine the extent of the misconduct or to explore additional issues. If an admission is made, the Vice President for Research or the Office of Legal Affairs may seek advice from ORI, or other relevant governmental agencies, in determining whether there is a sufficient basis to close a case, after the admission is fully documented and all appropriate procedural steps are taken. If the case is closed, the report should be forwarded to the Vice President for Research as the Deciding Official with recommendations for appropriate University actions and then, if applicable, submitted to ORI or the other relevant governmental agency for review. If the respondent admits to the misconduct, the committee should consult with the Vice President for Research and the Office of Legal Affairs immediately.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.7.3</strong> After consultation with the Vice President for Research and the Office of Legal Affairs, the persons designated to conduct the inquiry will decide whether there is sufficient evidence of possible research misconduct to recommend further investigation. The scope of the inquiry does not include deciding whether misconduct occurred or conducting exhaustive interviews and analyses.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<h3>6.12.8 Inquiry Report</h3>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>6.12.8.1</strong> A written inquiry report must be prepared that states the name and title of the person or persons conducting the inquiry and expert consultants, if any; the allegations; if applicable the PHS support; a list of the research records reviewed; summaries of any interviews; a description of the evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate whether an investigation is warranted; and, their determination as to whether an investigation is recommended and whether any other actions should be taken if an investigation is not recommended. The Office of Legal Affairs will review the report for legal sufficiency. All relevant dates should be included in the report.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.8.2</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will provide the respondent with a copy of the draft inquiry report for comment and rebuttal. </p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>6.12.8.2.1</strong>. Confidentiality: The Vice President for Research and/ or the RIO may establish reasonable conditions for review to protect the confidentiality of the draft report.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<h4>6.12.8.3. Receipt of Comments: </h4>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>6.12.8.3.1</strong> Within ten (10) business days of their receipt of the draft report, the respondent will provide their comments, if any, to those conducting the inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.8.3.2</strong> Any comments that the respondent submits on the draft report will become part of the final report and record.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.8.3.3</strong> Based on the comments, the inquiry committee may revise the report as appropriate.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<p><strong>6.12.8.4</strong> The person or persons conducting the inquiry will transmit the final report and any comments to the Vice President for Research, who will make the determination of whether findings from the inquiry provide sufficient evidence of possible research misconduct to justify conducting an investigation. The inquiry is completed when the Vice President for Research makes this determination.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.8.5</strong> The Vice President for Research will notify both the respondent and the complainant in writing of their decision of whether to proceed to an investigation and will remind them of their obligation to cooperate in the event an investigation is opened.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.8.6</strong> The University must provide the respondent an opportunity to review and comment on the inquiry report.</p>
<p><strong>6.12.8.7</strong> If the allegations warrant an investigation and government funding is involved, then the University must provide ORI or the relevant governmental agencies, within thirty (30) business days, with the written findings and a copy of the inquiry report, and the respondent’s comments.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>6.12.8.7.1</strong> The report to ORI or other relevant governmental agency must include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
    <li>The name and position of the respondent; </li>

    <li>The charges for the investigation to consider. </li>
</ol>
If the University makes a decision not to investigate, the University must keep sufficiently detailed documentation of inquiries to permit a later assessment by ORI or other relevant governmental agency of the reasons why the University decided not to conduct an investigation. The University must keep these records in a secure manner for at least seven (7) years after the termination of the inquiry, and upon request, provide them to ORI or other authorized relevant governmental agency personnel.</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<p><strong>6.12.8.8</strong> The University must complete the inquiry within sixty (60) business days of its initiation unless circumstances clearly warrant a longer period. If the inquiry takes longer than sixty (60) days to complete, the inquiry record must include documentation of the reasons for exceeding the sixty (60) day period.</p>

</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<h3>6.12.9 Referral to Other Officials or Agencies</h3>
Information obtained during the inquiry regarding allegations other than research misconduct involving government funds should be referred to the responsible University officials and relevant government agencies.</div>
<!-- Level3 --><hr />
<h2>6.13 Conducting the Investigation</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>6.13.1</strong> The investigation should begin thirty (30) business days after determining that an investigation is warranted, and all aspects of the investigation completed within 120 business days from when the investigation started.</p>
<p><strong>6.13.2</strong> The purpose of the investigation is to explore in detail the allegations, to examine the evidence in depth, and to determine specifically whether research misconduct has been committed, by whom, and to what extent. The investigation will also determine whether there are additional instances of possible research misconduct that would justify broadening the scope beyond the initial allegations. This is particularly important where the alleged research misconduct involves clinical trials or potential harm to human subjects or the general public or if it affects research that forms the basis for public policy, clinical practice, or public health practice. The findings of the investigation will be set forth in an investigation report.</p>
<p><strong>6.13.3</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will immediately sequester any additional pertinent research records that were not previously sequestered during the inquiry. This sequestration should occur before or at the time the respondent is notified that an investigation has begun. The need for additional sequestration of records may occur for any number of reasons, including the University's decision to investigate additional allegations not considered during the inquiry stage or the identification of records during the inquiry process that had not been previously secured. The procedures to be followed for sequestration during the investigation are the same procedures that apply during the inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>6.13.4</strong> The Vice President for Research and/or the RIO will notify the respondent as soon as reasonably possible after the determination is made to open an investigation. The notification should include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>A copy of the inquiry report; </li>
    <li>The specific allegations; </li>
    <li>The sources of government funding if applicable; </li>
    <li>The definition of research misconduct; </li>
    <li>The procedures to be followed in the investigation, including the appointment of the investigation committee and experts; </li>
    <li>The opportunity of the respondent to be interviewed, to provide information, to be assisted by counsel, to challenge the membership of the committee and experts based on bias or conflict of interest, and to comment on the draft report;</li>
    <li>The fact that ORI will perform an oversight review of the report regarding PHS issues; and, </li>
    <li>An explanation of the respondent's right to request a hearing before the HHS Departmental Appeals Board if there is an ORI finding of misconduct under the PHS definition. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>6.13.5</strong> The Vice President for Research is responsible for conducting or designating others to conduct the investigation. </p>
<div class="subSection Level4">

<p><strong>6.17.3</strong> If the respondent, without admitting to the misconduct, elects to resign his or her position prior to the initiation of an inquiry, but after an allegation has been reported, or during an inquiry or investigation, the inquiry or investigation may proceed. If the respondent refuses to participate in the process after resignation, the committee will use its best efforts to reach a conclusion concerning the allegations, noting in its report the respondent's failure to cooperate and its effect on the committee's review of all the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>6.17.4</strong> Regardless of whether the University or ORI or other relevant governmental agency determines that research misconduct occurred, the Vice President for Research will undertake reasonable efforts to protect complainants who made allegations of research misconduct in good faith and others who cooperate in good faith with inquiries and investigations of such allegations. Upon completion of an investigation, the Provost will determine what steps, if any, are needed to restore the position or reputation of the complainant. The Vice President for Research is responsible for implementing any steps the Provost approves. The Vice President for Research will also take appropriate steps during the inquiry and investigation to prevent any retaliation against the complainant.</p>
<p><strong>6.17.5</strong> If the Vice President for Research determines an allegation was not made in good faith, the Provost will make a recommendation to the President regarding any administrative action that should be taken against the complainant.</p>
<p><strong>6.17.6</strong> University officials will take interim administrative actions, as appropriate, to protect Federal funds and ensure that the purposes of the Federal financial assistance are carried out.</p>
