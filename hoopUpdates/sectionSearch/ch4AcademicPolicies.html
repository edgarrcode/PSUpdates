<h2>4.2 Academic Freedom and Responsibility</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<h3>4.2.1 Academic Freedom</h3>
<p>Academic freedom is an indispensable element of that larger liberty that includes the right to free expression.  Because a free society and freedom itself rest upon the continuous search for knowledge, and because institutions of higher education are primary agencies for the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge, a faculty member is entitled to full academic freedom in research, in the publication of results and conclusions, and in the classroom presentation of his or her subject.</p>
<h3>4.2.2 Academic Responsibility</h3>
<p>Academic freedom, like any other freedom, carries with it concomitant responsibilities.  The requirements of scholarly statement and research in a field of specialization shall constitute the guidelines for these responsibilities. </p>
<p>Academic freedom does not extend to the promulgation and exploitation in the classroom of material that has no relationship to the subject being taught. </p>
<p>Academic responsibility imposes certain professional restraints on academicians in their roles as citizens.  Because faculty are identified as members of a learned profession and as representatives of the University, they should bear in mind that the public may judge both the profession and the University on the basis of public utterances.  Hence, when acting in their roles as citizens, faculty members are expected to be accurate in their statements, to respect the opinions of others, and to make it clear that they do not speak for the University or their profession. </p>
<p>As employees of a State institution of higher education, faculty members should refrain from involving the University of Texas System or The University of Texas at El Paso in partisan politics.</p>

<h2>4.4 Appointment, Promotion, Tenure, and Termination</h2>
<p>The general provisions and regulations governing tenure, promotion, and termination of employment as adopted by the Board of Regents are given in Regents' Rules and Regulations Series 31007, 31008, 30103, 31002, and 31003. These regulations, as applicable to The University of Texas at El Paso, are paraphrased below. Procedures and criteria established to be used at the University of Texas at El Paso are given specifically in 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 below. All faculty members should familiarize themselves with these promotion and tenure regulations.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<h3>4.4.1 Tenure and Promotion</h3>
<p>Tenure denotes a status of continuing appointment as a member of the faculty at The University of Texas at El Paso. Generally, only members of the faculty with the academic titles of Professor, Associate Professor, or Assistant Professor may be granted tenure. Tenure may be granted at the time of appointment, or tenure may be awarded following satisfactory completion of a probationary period of faculty service.</p>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>4.4.1.1</strong> Only full-time service in the academic ranks of Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, and Instructor, or any combination thereof, shall be counted toward calculation of the maximum probationary period related to the acquisition of tenure. Periods during which a faculty member is on leave of absence shall not be counted toward fulfillment of the maximum probationary period.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.1.2</strong> Prior service at other academic institutions, whether inside or outside the U. T. System, shall not be counted toward calculation of the maximum probationary period. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.1.3</strong> The maximum period of probationary faculty service in non-tenure status in any academic rank or combination of academic ranks specified in 4.1.2.1 above shall be seven years of full‑time academic service.  No later than August 1 of the sixth academic year of the probationary period, all non-tenure faculty serving in a rank which accrues time toward period shall be given notice that the seventh academic year will be the terminal year of employment, or that beginning with the subsequent academic year, tenure will be granted.  In the event that the employment of a non-tenured faculty member is to be terminated prior to the end of the maximum probationary period, notice shall be given in accordance with 4.4.3.1 below.  </p>
<p><strong>4.4.1.4</strong> For purposes of calculating the period of probationary service, an “academic year” shall be the period from September 1st through the following August 31st.  If a faculty member is initially appointed during an academic year, the period of service from the date of the appointment until the following September 1st shall not be counted as academic service toward calculation of the maximum probationary period. A faculty member shall be considered to be in full-time academic service if he or she is in full compliance with requirements pertaining to minimum faculty workloads at the University.  </p>
<p><strong>4.4.1.5</strong> No later than August 1 of the sixth academic year of the probationary period all tenure-track faculty will be given notice that the seventh year is either the terminal year of appointment or that beginning with the subsequent academic year tenure will be granted.  In some cases full-time tenure-track faculty may be granted an extension to the seven year probationary period under the guidelines provided by Regents' Rules and Regulations Series 31007.  Only full-time faculty holding tenure-track rank (assistant professor, associate professor, or full professor) as defined by Regents' Rules and Regulations Series 31006 and 31001 are eligible to apply for an extension to the tenure-track probationary period.  </p>
<p>A faculty member who determines that certain personal circumstances may impede his or her progress toward achieving demonstration of eligibility for recommendation of the award of tenure must make a written request for extension of the probationary period outlining the details of the extension request. Personal circumstances that may justify the extension include, but are not restricted to, disability or illness of the faculty member; status of the faculty member as a principal caregiver of a preschool child; or status of the faculty member as a principal caregiver of a disabled, elderly, or ill member of the family of the faculty member. Requests must be made in advance of the academic year or semester for which the extension is justified and must be made at least three months before the faculty member initiates the mandatory tenure-review process. All requests shall be limited one academic year.  A request for an additional academic year’s extension may be requested; however the maximum duration of the extension, whether consecutive or nonconsecutive, shall be two academic years.</p>
<p>The written request should specify the reason(s) for the extension, time period requested, and be supported by appropriate documentation to adequately demonstrate why the extension request should be granted.  The written request and all supporting documentation should be forwarded to the Chair of the faculty member’s Department, who will review it and forward a written recommendation to the Dean of the College.  The Dean’s written recommendation will be forwarded to the Provost, who will make the final decision on the requested extension.  At all levels the review of the extension request will be considered in accordance with established policies and procedures for the evaluation of a candidate for tenure.  The faculty member shall be notified in writing of the recommendation made at all levels of review.  At any stage of the review process, additional supporting documentation may be requested or added to the extension request, and the extension request may be withdrawn by the faculty member.  The denial of an extension request  must be appealed  within 30 days of the final decision and will be handled in accordance with policies and procedures established for faculty evaluation appeals.</p>
<p>Additional information regarding faculty probationary period extensions or appeals may be obtained by contacting the Provost’s Office.</p>
<p>Following the approval of an extension request, a plan for the faculty member to meet his or her instructional and other academic responsibilities during the period of extension should be developed.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.1.6</strong> All faculty appointments are subject to the approval of the Board of Regents.  No non-tenured member of the faculty should expect continued employment beyond the period of his or her current appointment as approved by the Board of Regents.  Any commitment to employ a non-tenured member of the faculty beyond his or her current appointment shall have no force and effect until approved by the Board of Regents.  </p>
<p><strong>4.4.1.7</strong> A person appointed to a faculty position with the title of Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor at the University may not, during the term of such appointment, hold a tenured position on the faculty of another educational institution outside the U.T. System.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> Appointments to the faculty with the titles of Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, or Instructor shall be conditioned upon the appointee having resigned any tenured position that the appointee may then hold on the faculty of an educational institution outside the U.T. System.  Such resignation must be completed and effective prior to the effective date of the appointment at the University; otherwise, such appointment shall be void and of no effect.  </li>
    <li> The acceptance of an appointment to a tenured position on the faculty of an educational institution outside the U.T. System shall be considered as a resignation of any faculty position with the title of Instructor, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, or Professor that such appointee may hold at The University.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4.4.2 Termination</h3>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p>Termination by the University of the employment of a faculty member who has been granted tenure, and of all other faculty members before the expiration of the stated period of their appointment, except as is otherwise provided in 4.4.3, by resignation or retirement, or as otherwise provided in the Regents' Rules and Regulations, will be only for good cause shown. In each case, the issue will be determined by an equitable procedure, as outlined below and in accordance with Regents’ Rules and Regulations (Rule 31008), affording protection to the rights of the individual and to the interests of the University. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.1</strong> Review of Allegation. The President shall assure that all allegations against a faculty member that involve the potential for termination are reviewed under the direction of the Provost unless another officer is designated by the President.  The faculty member who is the subject of the allegations shall be given an opportunity to be interviewed and shall have the right to present a grievance, in person or through a representative, to the Provost on an issue or subject related to the allegations under review.  The Provost or another individual designated by the President if the allegations pertain to the Provost shall take the grievance, if any, into consideration prior to making a determination whether the allegations are supported by evidence that justifies the initiation of termination procedures.  Upon making that determination, the Provost or other appropriate designee will recommend to the President whether to proceed with charges for termination.   Failure to present a grievance to the Provost or other appropriate designee prior to his or her recommendation shall not preclude the faculty member from presenting an issue or subject to the special hearing tribunal in defense of charges for termination that may result from the review.  A tenured faculty member who is recommended for termination on the basis of periodic evaluation must be given the opportunity for referral of the matter to nonbinding alternative dispute resolution, as required by applicable legislation and policies and procedures for alternative dispute resolution within The University of Texas System and the University, prior to referral of the charges to a hearing tribunal. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.2</strong> Response to Allegations.  If the President determines that the allegations are supported by evidence that justifies the initiation of termination procedures, the President will meet with the faculty member, explain the allegations and supporting evidence, and give the faculty member a reasonable amount of time, as determined by the President, to respond either orally or in writing.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.2.1.1</strong> The President may in the best interest of the institution suspend an accused faculty member with pay pending the completion of the hearing and a final decision as hereinafter provided.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.2.2</strong> In cases of incompetence, gross immortality, or felony, where the facts are admitted, summary dismissal will follow.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<p><strong>4.4.2.3</strong> Hearing Tribunal. In cases where other offenses are charged, and in all cases where the facts are in dispute, the accused faculty member will be informed in writing of the charges. The charges will be heard by a special hearing tribunal comprised of at least three (3) faculty members whose academic rank and tenure is at least equal to that of the accused faculty member. The hearing tribunal members shall be appointed by the President from a standing pool of members of the faculty. At least 50% (fifty percent) of the standing pool members shall be selected by a procedure established by the faculty senate; the remaining standing pool members shall be selected by the President. A minimum of one (1) member of the hearing tribunal appointed by the President is to be from among standing pool members selected by the faculty senate for the standing pool. </p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.2.3.1</strong> The accused faculty member will be notified of the names of the faculty members selected for the hearing tribunal, and the date, time and place for the hearing.  Notice of such shall be provided at least eight (8) working days prior to the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.3.2</strong> In every such hearing the accused will have the right to appear in person and by counsel of choice and to confront the cross-examine witnesses who may appear.  If counsel represents the accused faculty member, the institution is entitled to be represented by counsel from System Administration’s Office of General Counsel.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.3.3</strong> The accused faculty member shall have the right to testify, but may not be required to do so and may introduce all evidence, written or oral, that may be relevant or material to the defense. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.3.4</strong> A stenographic or electronic record of the proceedings will be taken and filed with the Board of Regents, and such record shall be made accessible to the accused. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.3.5</strong> A representative of the University may appear before the hearing tribunal to present witnesses and evidence against the accused faculty member and in support of the charge brought against such faculty member, and such representative shall have the right to cross-examine the accused faculty member (if the faculty member testifies) and the witnesses offered on behalf of the faculty member.  The University has the burden to prove good cause for termination by the greater weight of the credible evidence.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.3.6</strong> The hearing tribunal shall not include any accuser of the faculty member. If the accused faculty member is not satisfied with the fairness or objectivity of any member or members of the hearing tribunal, he or she may challenge the alleged lack of fairness or objectivity, but any such challenge must be made prior to the submission of any evidence to the hearing tribunal. The accused faculty member shall have no right to disqualify any such member or members from serving on the tribunal. It shall be up to each such challenged member to determine whether the member can serve with fairness and objectivity in the matter. In the event of voluntary disqualification, the President shall appoint a substitute member of the tribunal. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.3.7</strong> The hearing tribunal, by a majority of the total membership, will make written findings on the material facts and a recommendation of the continuance or termination of the accused faculty member's employment. The hearing tribunal, by a majority of its total membership, may make any supplementary suggestions it deems proper concerning the disposal of the case. The original copy of such findings and the basic recommendation, together with any supplementary suggestions, shall be delivered to the President with a copy thereof to the faculty member. If minority findings, recommendations, or suggestions are made, they shall be similarly treated.  The original transcript of the testimony and the exhibits shall also be forwarded to the President.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<p><strong>4.4.2.4</strong> President’s Report. Within fourteen (14) workdays after receipt of the findings and recommendations of the hearing tribunal, the President shall make one of the following decisions based solely on the evidence of record in the proceedings and report that decision in writing to the accused faculty member:</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.2.4.1</strong> The President may decide to dismiss the matter or impose sanctions short of termination.  In this case, the President’s decision is final and the Board of Regents will not review the matter. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.4.2</strong> If the allegations are supported by evidence that constitutes good cause for termination, the President may decide to recommend termination to the Board of Regents.  If so, the President shall forward the findings and recommendations of the hearing tribunal, the original transcript of the testimony and the exhibits to the Board of Regents for its review, along with the President’s report.  If the President’s recommendation is not the same as the majority recommendation of the hearing tribunal, the President shall state the reasons for the President’s decision to recommend termination in his or her report.  The accused faculty member may, within seven workdays after receiving the President’s report, submit a written response to the Board of Regents.  The response must be based solely on the evidence of record in the proceeding. </p>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<p><strong>4.4.2.5</strong> Board Review. The Board of Regents, by a majority of the total membership, will approve, reject, or amend such findings, recommendation, and suggestions, if any, or will recommit the report to the same tribunal for hearing additional evidence and reconsidering its findings, recommendation, and suggestions, if any. Reasons for approval, rejection, or amendment of such findings, recommendation, or suggestion will be stated in writing and communicated to the faculty member. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.6</strong> Reasons  for  Termination  Not  Required.     Full-time faculty members, other than tenured faculty members, who are notified that they will not be reappointed or have not been reappointed are not entitled to a statement of the reasons upon which the decision for such an action is based.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.1</strong> Full-time faculty members, other than full-time tenure track faculty members, may, however, present a grievance concerning the decision, in person, through the procedures described in Section V. Chapter 7 of this Handbook of Operating Procedures.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.2</strong> Full-time faculty members  who, in accordance with 4.4.3.1, are notified that they will not be reappointed or that the subsequent academic year will be the terminal year of appointment are not entitled to a statement of the reasons upon which the decision for such action is based. Such a decision shall only be subject to review pursuant to the following procedures:</p>
<div class="subSection Level6">
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.2.1</strong> Grievance. The affected faculty member may present a grievance, in person or through a representative, to the Provost or another individual designated by the President if the allegations pertain to the Provost on an issue or subject related to a nonrenewal decision.  The Provost shall meet with the faculty member.  Unless a review by a hearing tribunal is requested and granted pursuant to Section 4.4.2.7.2. below, the nonrenewal decision shall not be subject to further review. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.2.2</strong> Hearing Tribunal to Hear Grievance. A review by a hearing tribunal shall be granted only in those cases where the affected faculty member submits a written request for review by a hearing tribunal to the President and describes in detail the facts relied upon to prove that the decision was made for reasons that are unlawful under the Constitution or laws of Texas or the United States of America.  If the President determines that the alleged facts, if proven by credible evidence, support a conclusion that the decision was made for unlawful reasons, such allegations shall be heard by a hearing tribunal under the procedures established in Section 4.4.2.4 above as in the case of dismissal for  cause, with the following exceptions:</p>
<div class="subSection Level7">
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.2.2.1</strong> The burden of proof is upon the affected faculty member to establish by greater weight of the credible evidence that the decision in question was made for reasons that are unlawful under the Constitution or laws of Texas or the United States of America;</p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.2.2.2</strong> The University administration need not state the reasons for the questioned decision or offer evidence in support thereof unless the affected faculty member presents credible evidence that, if unchallenged, proves the decision was made for unlawful reasons.  </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.2.2.3</strong> The hearing tribunal shall make written findings and recommendations based on the evidence presented at the hearing and shall forward such findings and recommendations with the transcript and exhibits from the hearing to the President. </p>
<p><strong>4.4.2.6.2.2.4</strong> The President may approve, reject, or amend the recommendations of the hearing tribunal or may reach different conclusions based upon the record of the hearing.  The decision of the President shall be final.</p>

<p><strong>4.4.4.2.2</strong> Assessment of Academic Program.  The committee will review and assess the academic programs under consideration for possible elimination or reduction, and identify those academic positions that may be eliminated with minimum effect upon the degree programs that should be continued and upon other critical components of the University's mission.  </p>
<p>The review will include, but not be limited to, as relevant: (a) an examination of the course offerings, degree programs, supporting degree programs, teaching specialties, and semester credit hour production; (b) an evaluation of the quality, centrality, and funding of research activities; (c) an assessment of the productivity, community service, and quality of clinical services (in relation to teaching, healthcare delivery, and scholarly activity); (d) demand for graduates and/or (e) ability to meet professional accrediting standards.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.2.3</strong> Review Consideration.  Upon determining that one or more academic positions in a degree program or teaching specialty should be eliminated, the committee will recommend to the President, in writing the particular position or positions to be terminated after reviewing the academic, research, and clinical qualifications and talents of holders of all academic positions in those degree programs or clinical or academic teaching specialties, the needs of the program they serve, past performance, and the potential for future contributions to the development of the University.  Tenure status of a faculty member shall not be a consideration in the determination of whether a particular position should be eliminated except as permitted below.</p>
<div class="subSection Level6">
<p><strong>4.4.4.2.3.1</strong> Tenure preference.  If, in the opinion of the committee, two or more faculty members are equally qualified and capable of performing the same teaching, research, and/or clinical role, the faculty member or members having tenure shall be given preference over nontenured faculty.  However, if such faculty members have the same tenure status and equal qualifications, consideration will be given to the other documented needs of the University.</p>

<p><strong>4.4.4.2.7.5</strong> No other issues shall be heard or considered by the hearing committee.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level6 -->
<p><strong>4.4.4.2.8</strong> Establishment of date.  The date for abandoning or phasing out an academic program should take into consideration the time required for anticipated completion by students currently enrolled or for facilitation of their placement in acceptable alternative programs.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.2.9</strong> Requests for Reassignment.  The President or designee will notify tenured faculty in the program to be abandoned and ask each faculty member to inform the President or designee, in writing of the faculty member's request for reassignment to other academic program(s) and to provide details of their qualifications for appointment to such academic program(s).</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.2.10</strong> Employment Alternatives.  The President or designee will meet individually with tenured faculty who respond to discuss employment alternatives to termination.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.2.11</strong> Non-retention.  If the decision is not to retain, the President or designee, will send a written response stating reasons for non-retention.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.2.12</strong> Displacement.  If retention of a tenured faculty member results in displacement of a tenured faculty member in another program, the displaced faculty member is entitled to the above procedures.</p>

</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<h4>4.4.4.3 Elimination Due to an Institutional Financial Exigency.</h4>
<p>When such reductions are necessary as a result of financial exigency, the procedure for the selection and notification of those academic positions that are to be terminated shall be governed by this Handbook of Operating Procedures, and Rule 31003 Section 3 of the Regent's Rules and Regulations.  Neither the procedures specified in Rule 31008 of the Regent's Rules and Regulations concerning termination of a faculty member, the notice requirements of Rule 31007, Section 5 concerning tenure, nor Rule 31002, Sections 1 and 2, concerning notice of nonrenewal to nontenured faculty members, shall be applicable.</p>
<p>Financial Exigency shall be defined as:  a demonstrably bona fide financial crisis that adversely affects the University as a whole and that, after considering other cost-reducing measures, including ways to cut faculty costs, requires consideration of terminating appointments held by tenured faculty.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.1</strong> Committee Recommendations.  Upon determining the existence of a financial exigency and the need to reduce academic positions or academic programs, or both, the President shall appoint a committee composed of faculty and administrative personnel to make recommendations to the President as to which academic positions and/or academic programs should be eliminated as a result of the financial exigency.  </p>
<p>The faculty members of this committee shall be a majority of the total membership of this committee.  At least one-half of the faculty members will be selected by the President from a slate of tenured faculty members developed by the Faculty Senate.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.2</strong> Assessment of Academic Program.  The committee will review and assess the academic programs of the university, and identify those academic positions that may be eliminated with minimum effect upon the degree programs that should be continued and upon other critical components of the University's mission.  The review will include, but not be limited to, as relevant: (a) an examination of the course offerings, degree programs, supporting degree programs, teaching specialties, and semester credit hour production; (b) an evaluation of the quality, centrality, and funding of research activities; and/or (c) an assessment of the productivity, community service, and quality of clinical services (in relation to teaching, healthcare delivery, and scholarly activity), (d) demand for graduates and/or (e) ability to meet professional accrediting standards.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.3</strong> Review Consideration.  Upon determining that one or more academic positions in a degree program or teaching specialty should be eliminated, the committee will recommend to the President, in writing the particular position or positions to be terminated after reviewing the academic, research, and clinical qualifications and talents of holders of all academic positions in those degree programs or clinical or academic teaching specialties, the needs of the program they serve, past performance, and the potential for future contributions to the development of the University.  Tenure status of a faculty member shall be a consideration in the determination of whether a particular position should be eliminated, as permitted in 4.4.4.3.4 below.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.4</strong> Tenure preference.  If, in the opinion of the committee, two or more faculty members are equally qualified and capable of performing the same teaching, research, and/or clinical role, the faculty member or members having tenure shall be given preference over nontenured faculty.  However, if such faculty members have the same tenure status and equal qualifications, consideration will be given to the other documented needs of the University.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.5</strong> Recommendation.  Upon completion of its review, the financial exigency review committee shall promptly recommend in writing to the President those persons who may be terminated, ranked in order of priority, with the reasons for their selection.  </p>
<p>The President shall, with such consultation with such administrative officers as the President may deem appropriate, determine which academic positions from among those identified by the committee are to be terminated because of the financial exigency, and shall give the holders of these positions written notice of the decision.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.6</strong> Notification of Vacancies.  Any person terminated due to financial exigency will be notified when a vacancy occurs at the University in their field of teaching or expertise within the next two (2) academic years following the termination.  If such person makes timely application and is qualified for the position to be filled, they shall be offered employment in that position.  If the vacancy is in a field of teaching or expertise in which two or more persons have been terminated because of financial exigency, all will be notified of the vacancy, and of those so notified and making timely applications, employment will be offered to the person who is the better qualified for the position to be filled.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.7</strong> Hearing Committee.  The President shall appoint a hearing committee comprised of faculty members to hear any appeals for reconsideration of termination decisions based upon financial exigency.  At least one-half of the faculty members will be selected by the President from a slate of tenured faculty members developed by the Faculty Senate.  Within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice of termination, a faculty member shall have the right to appeal to the hearing committee for reconsideration of the termination decision.  The appeal for reconsideration shall be in writing and addressed to the President of the University.  A faculty member who appeals to the hearing committee (the appellant) shall be given a reasonably adequate written statement of the basis for the initial decision to reduce academic positions and, upon request of the person, shall be given all written data or information relied upon in arriving at such decision.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.8</strong> Appeal Procedures.  The hearing committee shall set the date, time, and place for hearing the appeal for reconsideration.  Such hearing shall be held within thirty (30) days of the date of the written request, unless the appellant waives such time requirement; however, such hearing shall be held within ninety (90) days from the date of the request.  The hearing committee shall conduct the hearing in accordance with the following conditions and procedures;</p>
<div class="subSection Level6">
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.8.1</strong> The hearing will be closed to the public unless requested to be open by the appellant.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.8.2</strong> The appellant may be represented by legal counsel at his or her own expense.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.8.3</strong> The appellant and the University may offer any written evidence or oral testimony that is material to the issues.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.8.4</strong> The burden shall be upon the appellant to show by a preponderance of the credible evidence that:</p>
<div class="subSection Level7">
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.8.4.1</strong> Financial exigency was not in fact the reason for the initial decision to reduce academic positions; or</p>
<p><strong>4.4.4.3.8.4.2</strong> The decision to terminate the appellant as compared to another individual in the same discipline or teaching specialty was arbitrary and unreasonable based upon the evidence presented.</p>

<h3>4.4.5 University Procedures </h3>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<h4>4.4.5.1 Flow of Information</h4>
<p>In the procedures to be outlined, the flow of information is from the Department Chair to the Dean of the College and then to the Provost and the President.</p>
<h4>4.4.5.2 Appointment: Initiation and Terms</h4>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Recommendations for appointments shall be initiated by the Chair of each department or comparable academic unit, after consultation with appropriate departmental committees. After review by the appropriate Academic Dean or Deans (including, where relevant, the Head of the Graduate School) and the Provost, the recommendations shall be submitted to the President.</li>
    <li>Each faculty member shall be provided with a statement in writing of the terms of his/her appointment. Any such statement of terms must be issued by the President or the President's delegate.</li>
</ol>
<h4>4.4.5.3 Initial Appointment and Promotion: Criteria</h4>
<p>The following are minimum expectations for initial appointment and subsequent promotion to particular ranks. Individual departments are free to impose more stringent standards, as long as these standards are approved by the Dean of the College and the Provost, and the standards are applied consistently within the department. The framework for decisions concerning rank outlined in 4.4.6 below should also be consulted.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<h5>4.4.5.3.1 Instructor</h5>
<p>Because those appointed as Instructors may hold tenure‑track positions, appointment at this level should be reserved for those who are judged to have the potential for being promoted to the professorial ranks within a reasonably brief period of time.</p>
<h5>4.4.5.3.2 Assistant Professor</h5>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the Assistant Professor should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Hold the terminal degree appropriate for the discipline.</li>
    <li>Show clear ability or competence in teaching at the university level.</li>
    <li>Show evidence of ability to contribute to the knowledge base of the discipline and display a commitment to do so.</li>
    <li>Qualify for membership in the Graduate Assembly and show potential for continued membership.</li>
</ol>
<h5>4.4.5.3.3 Associate Professor</h5>
<p>The criteria that must be satisfied for appointment as, or promotion to, Associate Professor are similar to those for the granting of tenure, and are listed in 4.4.6.1.</p>
<h5>4.4.5.3.4 Professor</h5>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the Professor should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>The individual must have demonstrated excellence in teaching. Evidence may include the effective presentation of standard courses; development of new methodology or courses; active involvement in departmental and college curricular matters; active participation in student‑related activities; demonstrated interest in the welfare of students; and student, ex‑student, and peer evaluation.</li>
    <li>The individual must have actively and regularly contributed to graduate students through the teaching of graduate courses and through the supervision of graduate research. If the departmental program is such that regular contribution has not been possible, the candidate must provide other evidence of capability of teaching at this level.</li>
    <li>The individual must be judged to be a mature scholar in his or her discipline. Research accomplishments should be evidenced by continued publication of significant scholarly works in prestigious reference journals, or by continued appropriate artistic expression. Quality and frequency of published works, exhibitions, or performance should be comparable to those in the discipline holding professorial rank at high quality academic institutions. Normally, evidence of this criterion will include Senior Membership in the Graduate Assembly.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<h4>4.4.5.4 Initiation of Promotion or Tenure Review Procedures</h4>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances, consideration of an individual for promotion or tenure will be initiated by the department.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.5.4.1</strong> The department shall review the performance of all tenure-track faculty annually to evaluate progress toward the possible acquisition of tenure. Normally, the recommendation for tenure shall be made only in the sixth year of an individual's probationary service. Recommendation of an individual for early awarding of tenure should be based only upon truly outstanding performance.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.5.4.2</strong> The department shall review the performance of all tenured and tenure‑track faculty annually to evaluate progress toward and determine eligibility for promotion. Recommendation for promotion should be based only on the criteria specified in 4.4.5.3.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level5 -->
<h4>4.4.5.5 Departmental Procedures</h4>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.5.5.1</strong> Documentation related to promotion and tenure recommendations will be assembled by the Department Chair, a standing committee of the department, or an ad hoc committee appointed by the Chair. The candidate will be requested to supply items a. and g. listed below.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.5.5.2</strong> The documentation shall ordinarily include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">

    <li>Information related to Department, College, and University service, and to profession-related service outside the University;</li>
    <li>At least two objective letters of evaluation from reputable individuals in the discipline who have never been closely associated with the candidate or the University. These letters shall be solicited by the Department Chair. Letters already obtained on behalf of the candidate for senior membership in the Graduate Assembly may be used if appropriate and timely. Evaluation letters will not normally be required when the recommendation is for promotion from instructor to Assistant Professor.</li>
    <li>Other optional information or supporting documents that may be relevant to the decision, e.g., citations of scholarly work.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4.4.5.5.3</strong> All department members participating in a tenure or promotion decision shall have an opportunity to study the candidate's file in advance. It should be noted that at the departmental level the primary criterion for recommendations of promotion or tenure is the performance of the individual. Factors to be considered shall include, but are not limited to, an evaluation of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>Teaching effectiveness;</li>
    <li>Quality of publications, including quality of the journals or other publication outlets;</li>
    <li>Quality of the shows, performances, awards, etc. for those in the arts;</li>
    <li>Quality of profession‑related service outside the University;</li>
    <li>Evaluation letters and the credentials of the evaluators;</li>
    <li>The candidate's contributions to the Department, the College, the University, and the discipline as appropriate;</li>
    <li>The candidate's potential for future intellectual development and future contributions to the University.</li>
</ol>
<h5>4.4.5.5.4 Departmental vote</h5>
<p>Only tenured faculty in a department are eligible to vote on recommendations for tenure. Only faculty in a department of a rank higher than the candidate are eligible to vote on recommendations for promotion. If there is not a sufficient number (3 or more) of faculty eligible to vote, the Dean of the College, in consultation with the Department Chair, shall appoint additional voting members from related disciplines.</p>
<h5>4.4.5.5.5 Department Chair's report</h5>

<h3>4.4.6 Criteria for Promotion and Tenure at The University of Texas at El Paso</h3>
<p>Because of the subjective nature of judgments to be made and the diversity of the disciplines for the University faculty, the criteria for tenure and promotion cannot be specified in such detail that they can be applied automatically. Nevertheless, the following general guidelines and basic principles should be adhered to whenever possible:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>All University faculty are expected to perform the minimum duties specified in 4.3 above. Performance of those duties is necessary to be adjudged a University faculty member who is performing satisfactorily; however, satisfactory performance is not sufficient for the awarding of tenure or promotion;</li>
    <li>Similar criteria for recommendations for promotion and tenure should be used in all units of the University. Unless they conflict with the provisions of this Handbook, academic units are permitted to use such procedures as they devise, provided they have been approved by the Dean of the College and the Provost. Those procedures shall be communicated to the affected faculty.</li>
    <li>As the faculty of the University develops, the standard of performance for recommendation for promotion and tenure should change. If a faculty member's accomplishments do not keep pace with the current standards of performance for promotion and tenure, that individual may not be awarded tenure or advanced in rank. It is not appropriate to argue that a candidate be awarded tenure or promotion because he or she meets the performance standards that were previously in effect when others in that department may have received tenure or promotion.</li>
    <li>Years in service is a factor, but is not to be used as a primary justification for tenure or promotion recommendations.</li>
</ol>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<h4>4.4.6.1 Tenure</h4>
<p>The single most important decision made by the University with respect to the individual faculty member is to grant the individual tenure. Tenure is awarded by the University as a concomitant of its larger pledge to protect the academic freedom of productive scholars, regardless of whether their work or ideas may be unpopular or controversial. Tenure is an important commitment made only to those faculty members who have a history of performance in all areas that is significantly above the criteria for a satisfactory rating, and who have demonstrated significant potential for continued performance at that level, and for developing new knowledge and practice. The success of College and University programs is highly dependent upon the qualifications of the available tenured faculty. Therefore, tenure decisions will include consideration of factors related to planned programmatic changes.</p>
<div class="subSection Level5">
<p><strong>4.4.6.1.1</strong> The recommendation to award tenure will generally be made during the sixth year of full-time academic service, unless an individual's performance is truly outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.6.1.2</strong> Normally, only those faculty members with the terminal degree appropriate for the discipline may be awarded tenure.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.6.1.3</strong> Only faculty members who have demonstrated their competence in teaching may be awarded tenure. This competence may be demonstrated in diverse ways, e.g., development of superior course materials or textbooks and excellence in the supervision of research, in supervision of practicum or internship work, or in individual instruction in the fine arts, etc. Student and/or peer evaluation of teaching performance is an essential part of the demonstration of teaching competence.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.6.1.4</strong> A faculty member will not normally be granted tenure without clear evidence of competence and willingness to teach at all three levels of instruction (i.e., lower division, upper division, and graduate). Thus, under ordinary circumstances, tenure will be awarded only to those who are members of the Graduate Faculty and show evidence that they will be able to retain such membership in the future. Special justification must be provided for a tenure recommendation for any faculty member who cannot teach at all three levels.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.6.1.5</strong> Minimum expected performance standards require a faculty member to remain current in the discipline; therefore, this factor alone is not a sufficient basis for the recommendation of tenure.</p>
<p><strong>4.4.6.1.6</strong> A faculty member will not be granted tenure without a clear history of significant contributions to the advancement of knowledge in his or her discipline of expertise. The faculty member must also be judged to be likely to continue making such contributions for the rest of the career. Therefore, the following criteria are offered as guidelines in evaluating scholarly activity of a faculty member:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>A history of publication in refereed journals or other refereed outlets at a rate appropriate for the discipline. The quality of the published work, as well as the quality of the outlet, are to be judged. There should be no attempt to impose any particular number of contributions necessary for recommendation for tenure and promotion or to balance quantity of contributions against quality.</li>
    <li>The importance of the work to the discipline should be judged not only by the departmental faculty, but also by the outside evaluators. For example, letters of evaluation may be used to confirm the judgment of the department.</li>
    <li>In order for a scholarly effort to have made a demonstrable contribution to a discipline, it should have been brought into a public forum by a process that includes peer review and an evaluation of the importance of the work by nationally known scholars or practitioners. Usually, this means that works must be published or displayed in recognized outlets appropriate for the discipline. Experiments completed but not published, books or articles in draft form, classified documents, and undisplayed works of art, for example, are considered to be essentially private works and not yet in the public domain. They may, of course, be considered along with an individual's other accomplishments, but they cannot be used to satisfy this criterion.</li>
    <li>Routine applications of already accepted knowledge or of theory are not normally considered to be contributions to the advancement of knowledge in the discipline. The distinction between what is and is not a contribution to the advancement of knowledge may, at times, be subtle, but the burden of proof falls on the candidate.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>4.4.6.1.7</strong> Since participation in department, college, and University activities is expected of all faculty, such involvement is not adequate justification to award tenure.</p>

<h2>4.14 Alleged Student Scholastic Dishonesty</h2>
<p>Under the Regents' Rules and Regulations, the Dean of Students has authority and responsibility for the administration of student discipline.  Specific provisions and requirements regarding student conduct and discipline at the University are contained in Section II, Student Affairs, of this Handbook, available electronically on the Internet at http://admin.utep.edu/hoop/.  In most instances, the distinction between academic and disciplinary matters is clear-cut.  However, this may not always be the case when possible scholastic dishonesty is involved.  Accordingly, the following guidelines are provided: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>All alleged acts of scholastic dishonesty must be reported to the Dean of Students for disposition.  It is the Dean of Students' responsibility to investigate each allegation and dismiss the allegation, or proceed with disciplinary action that provides the accused student due process. </li>
    <li>It is a violation of the Regents' Rules and Regulations for a faculty member to withdraw a student or to assign a grade such as an "F" or "zero" to an assignment, test, examination, or other course work as a sanction for admitted or suspected dishonesty in lieu of reporting the alleged violation to the Dean of Students.  Such action is a disciplinary penalty that violates the student's right to due process and leaves the faculty member vulnerable to a student grievance petition, a civil lawsuit, and possible disciplinary action by the University.  Similarly, students are prohibited from proposing an arrangement with a faculty member to receive any reduced grade in lieu of being reported to the Dean of Students for suspected scholastic dishonesty.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>4.15 Grade Review Process</h2>
<p>Any student may request a faculty member to review and re-evaluate a grade previously given the student by that faculty member.  Students may also seek assistance or intervention from the Department Chair or other appropriate academic administrator in obtaining a grade review by a faculty member.  Ordinarily only the responsible faculty member may submit a change in a final course grade which has been previously submitted to the Registrar, except as provided below.  The formal process outlined below is to be available in cases where a student wishes to appeal a grade assigned by a faculty member when the student contends that the grade assigned was the product of malicious, biased, arbitrary, or negligent determination or impermissible discrimination.  No challenge to grading standards shall be pursued on any grounds other than these.  This process may not be used to adjudicate cases of suspected student misconduct, plagiarism, or collusion.  Formal grade appeals must be officially filed with the Student Grievance Committee of the Faculty Senate no later than one year after the official grade has been released to the student; for a student who has graduated, the filing deadline is three months following the semester in which the degree was awarded.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<p><strong>4.15.1</strong> Any student who wishes to appeal a grade should talk first with the faculty member who assigned the grade.  If agreement cannot be reached, the student may consult with and/or file a grievance with the Chair of the Student Grievance Committee of the Faculty Senate.</p>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>4.15.1.1</strong> In order to file a grievance the student must complete the Student Grievance Committee Initial Complaint Form and provide documentation of having attempted to resolve the challenge directly with the faculty member who assigned the grade.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.1.2</strong> The Initial Complaint Form and all supporting material must be submitted in accordance with the procedures established by the Student Grievance Committee.  Students should contact the Office of Student Life for specific information or download a copy of the Initial Complaint Form and instructions on the Office of Student Life web page.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<p><strong>4.15.2</strong> The Chair of the Student Grievance Committee will then appoint a conciliator or a three-member conciliation committee selected from appropriate faculty sources.  If the grade challenge is in a graduate course, the conciliator must be a member of the graduate faculty; in the case of a committee, at least two of the members must be members of the graduate faculty.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.3</strong> Upon assignment of the conciliator, the Chair of the Student Grievance Committee will notify the appropriate faculty member, his/her immediate supervisor, his/her College/School Dean, the President of the Faculty Senate, and the Provost.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.4</strong> The conciliator/conciliation committee will meet with the student to investigate the validity of the charges and to ensure that they are based on the grounds given in 4.15 above.  The faculty member issuing the grade must be contacted at this stage of the proceedings and given the opportunity to provide information and clarification.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.5</strong> The conciliator(s) shall make a recommendation to the Student Grievance Committee for its consideration in a timely fashion.  This recommendation shall normally be made within six weeks of the date of appointment of the conciliator(s), counting only weeks of the long semester in which the grievance was filed and the subsequent long semester (not including intersession or summer periods).  If the conciliation process results in resolution of the issue, the Chair of the Student Grievance Committee will so notify the student, the faculty member, the President of the Faculty Senate and the Provost.  Should conciliation fail, the Student Grievance Committee may continue the conciliation effort with another conciliator or conciliation committee, reject the complaint, or appoint a hearing committee.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.6</strong> If the Student Grievance Committee determines that a hearing committee should be formed to resolve the issue, the Chair of the Grievance Committee shall appoint a committee after consultation with the parties involved.  The Hearing Committee shall consist of an appointed chair of the Hearing Committee and two members of the general faculty outside the department concerned.  No person involved with the conciliation effort may serve on the hearing committee.  </p>
<p>In a case involving graduate credit, the Hearing Committee chair and a majority of its members must be members of the graduate faculty.  Immediately on formation of a Hearing Committee, the chair of that Hearing Committee shall give written notice to the student and the faculty member involved.  The student and faculty member must be given at least one week's notice prior to the first meeting of the Hearing Committee.  Procedures for the conduct of the hearing are available from the Chair of the Student Grievance Committee and the Office of Student Life.</p>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>4.15.6.1</strong> Decision of the Hearing Committee.  The Hearing Committee shall make its decision to either dismiss the challenge or affirm the challenge with subsequent determination of the new grade.  The decision of the Hearing Committee is final.  The matter is not subject to review/approval by the full Student Grievance Committee.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.6.2</strong> Determination of New Grade.  The determination of a new grade shall be made as a separate proceeding by the Hearing Committee, who may solicit advice from the pertinent academic department.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.6.3</strong> Report of Hearing Committee and Implementation.  The Hearing Committee shall report its conclusions to the full Student Grievance Committee.  The Chair of the Student Grievance Committee shall be responsible for notifying the student, the faculty member, his/her supervisor, his/her College/School Dean, the Provost, and the President of the Faculty Senate.  The Chair of the Student Grievance Committee shall also inform the Registrar of any grade change.</p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<p><strong>4.15.7</strong> The Chair of the Student Grievance Committee will maintain a database of open grievance cases, and report their status and outcomes monthly to the President of the Faculty Senate and the Provost.</p>
<p><strong>4.15.8</strong> All decisions by the Student Grievance Committee and its appointed Hearing Committees are final and are not subject to appeal.  Should, within the term established in section 4.15 above, new information come to light, the student may begin the process anew by resubmitting the challenge as modified by the additional information.</p>
</div>

<h2>4.20 Faculty Credentialing</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University to ensure that all employees holding a Tenured, Tenure-track, or Lecturer (“Faculty”) title possess the academic preparation, training, and experience to teach in an academic setting and meet the minimum requirements of accrediting bodies and state agencies.  This policy applies to all full and part-time tenure, tenure-track, and lecturer (Faculty) titled positions.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
<h3>4.20.1 Guidelines for the Provost</h3>
The Provost is responsible for the verification and validation of all faculty credential requirements.  The verification and validation of these requirements will be compiled and listed on the “Faculty Credentials Verification” form.  This form combines the educational and experience requirement information from applicable accrediting agencies and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), and identifies and lists the credential requirements for faculty teaching in each college at the University.
<h3>4.20.2 Guidelines for Deans</h3>
Prior to any faculty member’s appointment with the University, the Dean of the college examines and approves the prospective faculty member’s credentials and folder to ensure that they meet the requirements listed by the respective accrediting agency.  The Dean will work with the Chair to acquire the documents required for the credentialing process.  The Dean will forward the completed “Faculty Credential” folder to the Provost for verification and signature.
<h3>4.20.3 Guidelines for Department Chairs</h3>
Prior to any faculty member’s appointment with the University, the Chair of the department examines the prospective faculty member’s credentials to verify that they meet the requirements of the position. If a transcript is unclear, the University will contact the institution producing the transcript, and request that the institution provide information regarding the transcript or courses in question.  In the event, the institution ceases to exist and there are no records or method of verification, the faculty member may be required to provide references to support academic course work.
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>4.20.3.1</strong> Verification of work and/or teaching experience exclusive of the application/resume, as required for a particular discipline will include the preparation of “Work Experience Verification” form, if applicable, and relevant documentation to verify the experience.  If the credentials meet or exceed those required, and a decision is made to hire the faculty member, the Chair will prepare a “Faculty Credentials” folder in accordance with current University standards.  The Chair will forward the completed “Faculty Credential” folder to the Dean for verification and signature. </p>
<p><strong>4.20.3.2</strong> Any faculty member teaching graduate courses must apply for membership in the Graduate Faculty through the Graduate Dean prior to the first day of class.   Members of the Graduate Faculty are expected to hold the doctorate or appropriate terminal degree.  Any exceptions must be documented by the department and documentation forwarded through the academic dean to the Dean of the Graduate School with the application for membership in the Graduate Faculty. </p>
<p><strong>4.20.3.3</strong> Individuals employed to teach graduate classes as part-time lecturers must provide an official transcript and current curriculum vitae/resume to the department chair/program director prior to the first day of class.  The department chair/program director is responsible for nominating each part time lecturer teaching graduate classes for temporary membership in the Graduate Faculty immediately on appointment for teaching duties.  A complete credential file is due to Human Resources no later than census day (12th day of class). </p>
</div>
<!-- Level4 -->
<h3>4.20.3 Guidelines for Faculty Members</h3>
<p>It is the responsibility of the prospective faculty member to provide the University with all of the documentation needed to verify their credentials.  This includes, but is not limited to, a resume/vitae, resume supplement, official transcripts (indicating terminal degree or other appropriate transcripts) appropriate licenses or certifications, and the verification of work related to teaching experience (as needed).  The cost to obtain official transcripts (including necessary translations and evaluations of foreign transcripts) and copies of licenses and certifications is borne by the prospective faculty member.  It is the responsibility of faculty members teaching in disciplines that require licensure and/or certification to acquire and maintain those credentials, and to provide documentation of licensure and certification for inclusion in the Faculty Credential folder to Human Resource Services (HRS).  The University may periodically request updated documents from faculty members to maintain the credential folders.  New faculty members must provide an official transcript at time of hire. </p>
<p>“All but Dissertation” (ABD) faculty members must provide an official transcript with proof of their terminal degree within one (1) year of their appointment.</p>
<h3>4.20.4 Human Resource Services and Faculty Credentialing</h3>
<p>The Chair will forward a copy of the acceptance of the offer to HRS within one (1) week of receipt.  HRS will place the letter in a “pending folder” to match the letter with the corresponding credential file to ensure that all the related documents have been received.  HRS will notify the appropriate Chair if there are any discrepancies in receipt of the credential folder.  If there are discrepancies, the Chair must submit the required credential documents within forty-five (45) days of hire for tenure and tenured-track faculty and thirty (30) days of date of hire for Lecturers.  Currently active lecturers working for the University will be given (30) days to comply once notified by the Chair. In terms of transcripts, the University requires official transcripts identifying degrees or coursework needed for credentialing.  Official transcripts are defined as those transcripts transmitted directly from the issuing institution to the University’s hiring department.</p>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>4.20.4.1</strong> HRS will maintain an electronic database of faculty credentials. </p>
<p>HRS will use the database to provide accurate, timely information to various accrediting agencies, federal, state, local agencies and college departments.  The “Faculty Credential” folder will be maintained by the HRS Department.  The folders are only available for review by the Chair, Dean, and the Provost in HRS.  Folders will not be issued outside HRS. </p>
<p><strong>4.20.4.2</strong> HRS will, once a semester, coordinate with the Department of Information Technology and the Office of the Provost to create a complete listing by department, of all faculty appointments.  HRS will perform a review to ensure a completed faculty credential folder is on file for all faculty with a current appointment.</p>

<h3>4.20.5 Alternative Credentialing</h3>
<p>When the credentials of the person do not meet the stated standards, but the prospective faculty member possesses outstanding professional experience and demonstrated contributions to the teaching discipline, the individual may be alternatively credentialed on recommendation of the Dean and approval of the Provost.  Sufficient objective documentation to support outstanding experience and demonstrated contributions are required to warrant consideration.  The candidate for alternative credentialing must provide to the Provost, through the appropriate Dean, the following documents: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>current resume or curriculum vitae; </li>
    <li>copy of official transcript(s); or </li>
    <li>memorandum from a faculty member to the Chair addressing specific outstanding professional experience and specific demonstrated contributions toward the teaching discipline.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4.20.6 Official Transcripts</h3>
<p>For purposes of this policy, an official transcript is defined as either stated on the document that it is official and possesses the following criteria.  Each individual official transcript must meet the authentication criteria based on that institution’s standards.  The transcripts must posses all of the following: </p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li>the issuing institution’s official seal; </li>
    <li>signature of the appropriate authorizing agent, preferable the institution’s Registrar;</li>
    <li>the institution’s official letterhead or stationary; </li>
    <li>the institution’s watermark or other identifier; and </li>
    <li>date of issue. </li>
</ol>
<p>The official transcripts are required to be sent to the faculty member’s department head or HRS.  Official transcripts that are issued to the former student (faculty member) are acceptable as long as they meet the criteria defined above.  It is the responsibility of the faculty member to provide the official transcript.   The Department Chair, Dean, and Provost are responsible for ensuring the authenticity of the transcript.  Transcripts that are classified as unofficial will not be accepted as official.</p>
<h3>4.20.7 Foreign Transcripts</h3>
<p>All transcripts submitted by a potential faculty member from foreign universities or schools must be evaluated for equivalency to United States accredited course work by a University approved agency.  All costs for these services are borne by the prospective employee.   Only course work and degrees granted by an accredited college or university, or an acceptable evaluation of foreign course work and degrees will be accepted for credentialing faculty.  The Chair maintains and distributes information regarding the processing of foreign transcripts.</p>
<h3>4.20.8 Transcripts from Non-Regional Accredited Institutions</h3>
<p>The hiring of individuals whose qualifying degree is from a non-regionally accredited institution in the United States (U.S.) will be considered on case-by-case basis.   When hiring such individuals, additional criteria beyond those listed in the Faculty Credential Requirements form must be considered.  Criteria to be considered include the degree issuing institution’s reputation, whether the institution is accredited or recognized by other agencies or organizations, and a thorough evaluation of the candidate’s course work and experience.  If such a hire is deemed desirable, then the Chair must fully evaluate the faculty member’s educational background and experience, and document the findings in a memorandum to the Provost.  If the Provost agrees that the individual possesses the appropriate academic preparation and experience, the Chair will prepare a Faculty Credential folder in accordance with current standards, and include the documentation of their findings in the folder.</p>
<h3>4.20.9 Pending Faculty Credential Folder</h3>
<p>At times it may be necessary to have a faculty member begin teaching prior to the receipt of an official transcript.  In these cases a folder will be prepared by the Chair containing all of the information except the official transcript(s).  An unofficial transcript must be included in the folder to show that the individual meets the credential requirements.  A copy of the request for an official transcript must be included in the folder.  The Chair will call the University/College and obtain over the phone conformation of the degree and major field.  Additionally, the Chair will attempt to confirm receipt of the transcript request and if there is any type of hold on the release of the transcript.  Once the official transcript arrives, it will be placed in the Credential Folder and all necessary signatures will be obtained.  There is a thirty (30) and forty five (45)-day period where a credential folder can be listed as “Pending” from the receipt of application.  Please reference Section V. of this policy for the appropriate timelines.</p>
<div class="subSection Level4">
<p><strong>4.20.9.1</strong> Current Lecturers:  If after the thirty (30) day period has elapsed and the credential folder has not been removed from “pending” status and the faculty member does not meet the credential requirements to perform the assigned duties, the individual will not be considered for hire, or if already employed, the individual will be removed from his or her assignment. Removal may result in the faculty member’s placement on Administrative Leave, with or without pay until the matter has been resolved. When the required documents have been received, the faculty member’s respective Dean will re-certify and place the faculty member in the former assignment.</p>
<p><strong>4.20.9.2</strong> New Hire Faculty Members:  If after the forty-five (45) day period has elapsed and the credential folder has not been removed from “pending” status and the faculty member does not meet the credential requirements to perform their assigned duties, they will not be considered for hire, or if already employed, the individual will be removed from their assignment.  Their removal may result in the faculty member’s placement on Administrative Leave, with or without pay until the matter has been resolved.  When the documents have been received, the faculty member’s respective Dean will re-certify and place the faculty member to their former assignment.</p>

<h2>4.21 Faculty Controlled Substance Policy</h2>
<p>The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) is committed to producing qualified, competent and responsible health care professionals. A fundamental aspect of the core curriculum for these professions includes the practical training received in area hospitals and clinical care facilities. A condition of being allowed to train in these healthcare facilities is that both the student and faculty member be tested for illegal drugs and that the tests produce a negative result. Therefore, this policy establishes that any faculty member with responsibilities at a healthcare facility with an affiliation agreement with UTEP requiring drug screening for faculty must undergo a drug test for the presence of illegal drugs. The test results must be negative for the faculty member to assume a position in this capacity or to continue performing in the assigned capacity.</p>
<p>Faculty needing help or rehabilitation in dealing with a drug problem are encouraged to contact, on a confidential basis, Human Resource Services, the respective Dean, the Provost or the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) representative for assistance. Conscientious efforts to seek assistance will not result in disciplinary action against the employee solely because the faculty member seeks counseling or treatment for chemical dependency.</p>
<div class="subSection Level3">
