<h2>Policy</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University to provide fair and equitable procedures in promoting a classified staff employee.  This policy will explain the conditions, types or promotion actions, process and salary adjustment action in the event a classified employee is considered for promotion.</p>

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<div class="subSection Level3">
    <h3>Conditions:</h3>
    <p>All classified staff employees may be eligible for promotion, if they have satisfactorily met all the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Successful completion of a probationary period of 180 days with no disciplinary action beyond a verbal warning and/or has not been on a performance related action plan as a result of unsatisfactory performance during the past annual review period in their present position. </li>
        <li>Submission of an updated application or resume to verify that the minimum qualifications for the open position are met. Any false information provided by an employee will be grounds for termination of employment according to the University’s Discipline and Dismissal Policy of Classified Staff (HOP, Section V, Chapter 6). </li>
        <li>Verification that the employee has been performing satisfactorily in their current/present position.</li>
        <li>Submission of a signed Criminal Background Check Authorization form, if a background check has not been conducted within the last two years.  </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types of Promotions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Inter/Intra-departmental Promotion</b><br>
                An intradepartmental promotion occurs when an active employee in a department/budget entity is promoted into an open/vacant position in a higher salary range within the same department/budget entity. These positions must be posted for a minimum of three (3) work days.</li>

        <li><b>Internal College/Division Promotion</b><br>
                An internal promotion occurs when an active employee, within a College or Division is promoted into an open/vacant position in a higher salary range within the same College or Division. These positions must be posted for a minimum of three (3) work days.</li>
         
        <li><b>Cross College/Division Promotion</b><br>
                A cross College/Division promotion occurs when an active employee within the University is promoted into an open/vacant position in a higher salary range in another College/Division within the University.  These types of promotions are filled via the job posting program. These positions must be posted for a minimum of five (5) work days</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process for Promotions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The hiring official must verify that the eligibility criteria for the employee’s promotion has been met, including to verifying the employee’s past work performance.</li>
        <li>The hiring official must follow the normal hiring process guidelines, when position has been posted.</li>
        <li>The receiving supervisor should receive a completed performance evaluation from the employee’s current supervisor. </li>
        <li>Human Services (HRS) Services and the respective Director/Vice President must approve all promotions in accordance with the Employee Actions Approval process and ensure compliance with applicable policies, rules and laws.</li>
        <li>Any promotional increase must be approved by the respective Director/Vice President before being communicated to the employee.</li>
        <li>After an employee has been reviewed and approved by HRS for promotion to another department, the Directors/Managers of the respective departments will determine a mutually acceptable transfer date. When assuming the new job, the start date will be a mutual agreement between the releasing supervisor and the receiving supervisor.  The employee does not decide the starting date.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Salary Adjustments for Promotions:</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>When an employee is promoted, the employee’s salary will be adjusted as follows: 
        <ol type="a">
            <li>To at least the minimum of the higher salary range for classified staff positions; or </li>

            <li>To the budgeted salary amount; or </li>

            <li>If already above the minimum of the new salary range, to a level within the salary range or budgeted salary amount that is equitable, based on the promoted employee’s related experience, qualifications and the salaries of the other employees in the same position.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>It is the University’s policy to bring an employee to the minimum of the grade level into which he/she is promoted if the previous salary was less.</li>
    <li>If a promoted employee is already within the salary range of the new position or the budgeted salary amount, then the promotional increase will range from 6% to 10%, depending upon the date of their last increase, which is usually the common review date.</li>
    <li>When an employee is promoted, his or her next merit increase will be during the common review process and will be prorated for time in position.</li>
    <li>If a promotion is being given to an employee during the common review process, the standard merit increase is calculated first and then the promotional guidelines above would apply.  In this case, the promotional increase in the 6% range would be considered, unless the employee is still below the minimum of the new salary range, at which time he or she will be brought to the minimum.</li>
    <li>Any promotional salary increases not included in this procedure must be in accordance with the current Employee Actions Approval process.</li>
    </ol>
